## OMG.cards

> In nature, things would move all around us. In houses, everything is still. Websites need interactive, animated elements nature inspired design direct manipulation. things move people feels powerless when clicking and getting no feedback. - Alex


## Brain Backup

- enter information daily like a diary
- It's about tracking yourself overtime but all with VIDEO LOGS
- notes searchable
- accessible forever on ipfs

I don't tend to read back the writing much. but in the video, I see how much I've changed. Alex said 'it's because you can't lie (in a video)'. I agree. It's the raw you. A feed of personal video logs




### Memory Recall

How about the sort of blog/feed We forget 80% of the information we experience every day. Speak, write or upload insights, information and experiences into your personal AI so you can recall your memories exactly when you need them.



### Competition


- [Daybridge](https://www.producthunt.com/products/daybridge#daybridge-private-alpha) best ui
- [Tangerine](https://tangerine.app/?ref=producthunt) is really close to what I'm thinking
- [mymind](https://www.producthunt.com/products/my-mind#mymind-82cba725-59f2-4f84-baf3-c1797165c44c) basically raindrop
- [Daily Journal](https://www.producthunt.com/products/daily-journal-2#daily-journal-2) publish things but in simple journal

- [GridDiary 2](https://griddiaryapp.com/?ref=producthunt) pretty ok. Not customised. Not immediately drawn to this.
- [Dayone](https://dayoneapp.com/blog/version-3/) I used to use this. It was so important to me to have those voice reodring, pictures added. I loved this. But it wasnt permenant in any way.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) beautiful visually. Limited on how you enter information
- [flow dash](https://www.producthunt.com/products/flow-dashboard#flow-dashboard) I like the github like blocks of achievement
- [everyday](https://everyday.app/?promo=PRODUCTHUNT2020&ref=producthunt)


## Digital Graves

- [Good Place](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/good-place)

> your digital monument, become digitally immortal

- IPFs hosted website of your life, who you were, you life lesons, your online avatar, pictures, videos...
- Maybe graves are located on areas of a map
- Things you want to share for future generations.

Everyone's going to die someday. Why is all I have of my nan digitally is her FaceBook page, I want to know what books inspired her the most in life, what the biggest lessons that she learnt were. I wanna see videos, pictures, memories all hoted up there so I can visit it whenever and not have to get a dusty photo album out of an attic for.

- By 2100 there could be 4.9bn dead users on Facebook. So who controls our digital legacy after we have gone?






### Memorial sites
I enjoyed reading about peoples lives on the sites, at first when the music stared I thought it was the woman herself singing, that would've been really nice. Or just to hear an audio clip of them talking.

### Chatbots that imitate your speech for loved ones
This is a 'record' of who you are in a totally diffferent way Replicka

Replika is an app where you can have a fun and sincere text conversation with a friend. Actually, they will ask you a lot of questions in the beginning to get to know you better. The more you speak with your Replika, the more it shares with you. It’ll tell you about your personality, will answer questions about you, and at some point, will be able to talk to your friends on your behalf.
the work on Replika started after Eugenia Kudyas friend Roman Mazurenko was killed in a car accident in late 2015. "We’ve collected his texts and trained an AI that was able to talk like him".
In Replika, we are helping you build a friend who is always there for you. It talks to you, keeps a diary for you, helps you discover your personality. This is an AI that you nurture and raise

## Task Management
- setting up your day is being your own manager, could be based in either the 'you' in your head trying to get you to complete tasks, or a manager of your life
- to do inbox

<img src='/img/akiflow.jpeg'  width='300px'/>


### Competition
- TickTick
- Akiflow (I use this one)
so easy, people love it


## RPG Task Tracker

- people like video games, earning xp points (Duolingo prime example of how hooking this is)
- saw an app a while ago that gives you points if you completed certain tasks Here is the app

This whole idea deserves a 3d, interactive, rpg makeover

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rim2rXIbVoA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Would be so cool to be able to make a character you can see and level that character up
Like when you work out more it gets more muscular.
You keep it by your side as you work, press 'work time' and it also gets out its laptop and works, logging time spent working
you unlock new wearables / items if you do '100 hours of programming' you get a laptop for the character to hold and nerd glasses
For me, a big thing I want to solve is productivity, getting shit done, feeling like I'm on a path to achieve goals.

clear objectives (quests), once completed a reward is given
define your goal and the necesary steps you need to take
give it a set reward (you only get a certain amount of 'coins' to earn per day for each task)
time limit option
daily reminder option
it can create a schedule for you out of your daily quests
books youre reading with last page read
work towards big goals overtime, add a bit onto big quests (say 200 hours in gym )

### Competition

- [Habitica](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.habitrpg.android.habitica&hl=en&pli=1)

From the sounds of reviews, this app was loved in its peak of popularity!, you could create an adenturing party, hang out in the tavern, or go to the forums.

wow, this app is fun already, 8 bit theme, the tutorial is cute like you're in a game too.

you can create your avatar and make basic changes

they ask for basic types of tasks you want then they give you a load of demo ones to choose from

the idea is to keep yourself accountable, with each task you either press + or - , and gain coins or loose health accordingly

with each task you can set a difficultly, add a reset and more

your coins can go to purchasing items in the shop such as outfits

whole to dos area, I like the layout a lot

Wiki Fandom Community super in depth wiki, really great wih examples

Recently updated Opensource github repo

great review here - "After three years of almost daily use, Habitica is essentially my desktop landing page; I can’t imagine life without it!"

workflow, ui of app is good found an exploit bug where you can keep clicking and get rewards (ruins aspect of rewards in app)

I don't want them to let me avoid certain tasks (deletion is easy and without reprecussion)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJDMGQjBarE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I don't want it to be monetary based as I'd drain my wallet way too fast

Vast wiki pages with so much to learn

Wasn't immediately clear how scoring works

the gamification adds a new incentive for doing things





in production, I like the concept of defeating an enemy with points realy lovely, reminds me of AdventureQuest Certainly makes it a literal big challenge you need to overcome
{' '}


{' '}


EpicWin
I'm smiling at the trailer it's really fun with the epic music and voiceover


website for this one is also down
app is hard to use, hasn't had an update in a long time, unusable
Amazing app. Wish they would update it for new Android version. Could be the number one app of this genre if they had a more detailed character creation, more diverse loot and armor sets/weapons or even classes or skills. Could be built up upon in so many ways. Hope myself or someone else comes up with something like this more fleshed out soon.

After a week of using this app, I've gotten a lot more motivation to do the things I need to do. My house looks much better and I feel better when I do these menial tasks. I think it has a lot to do with the sound effects that come along with the app. I highly recommend this app to anyone who has trouble getting motivation for those tasks they'd much rather procrastinate.

This app has a lot of promise, but doesn't quite deliver. Cute concept and animations, but difficult to use. The UI isn't very intuitive, and there's really not a lot of interactivity. All you can do is check things off your list and watch your avatar hit things. There are no negative consequences for something being overdue, and loot doesn't do anything besides fill up a completion list. The BGM and SFX don't work at all

I've looked all over for a life gamification app that has the features I actually want and is easy to use. This is it! It's super simple without having or needing a lot of customization. It has a fun, inspiring style, and lets you see your progress on a pretty map the way you would on an actual adventure game. The only one of its kind I've found that actually feels like a game and not a chore. UPDATE: No longer works on my version of Android, therefore the down-grade to 4 stars.

Cool concept based on other apps like Habitica. Graphics use 3D polygons. Pros - I venture to say this life app has the best graphics of any like it. Funny items and characters keep it light hearted. Cons - Occasional pop-up ads deliver a slightly annoying experience whereas other life game apps do not have these. Would be nice to have a paid version that has no ads. Ability to edit tasks is a little difficult to do, sometimes moving a task position instead of opening the edit window.

Would love a 'cuter' avatar, but that's really the only thing I'd change!

## Appear Human
Aspegers sucks and learning to communicate is hard

A manual to learn how to be human, or a least appear like one. For aliens who struggle to fit in and want the black and white answers. For anyone wanting the guide to confidence in social situations, the no bullshit look on social heriarchies on why the humans do what they do.

> KNow the humans. Speak like the humans. Become one with the humans

Premise is this. Newt takes video logs of her discoveries each day on the humans. She learns new things about how they function, how to blend in with them, and why they do the thingss they do. The video media must be entertaining in its own right.

## Founder Handbook


everything is possible its only how badly you want it

"you have to build it"

you need a really mission driven team

Talk about people not yourself so much, the people youre gonna help, how youre gonna do it

whenever I find myself stuck I remind myself "Lottie ur not a designer" why am I trying to mock up a chat app from scratch, go find opensource projects and start there

never start from a blank sheet, you've got google. USE ITe

Planning your lander

go to dribbble and awwards
take screenshots of sections you like
make one long frankensteins monster of a lander
have another one alongside it with your secondary options
Handling feedback (online and in person)

don't argue with people for not seeing the vision, thank them for their detailed and honest feedback and try to give an answer where you really listened to what they said and considered their critiques
would be so much better to continue the conversation (especially if in public forum) and see if you can address their needs also
I wanted a way into this space, but basically, I don't know anything about SEO, nor do I know how to program.

## Sex Work Startups
some ideas based in making the lives of sex workers easier



> DO NOT do sex work

The project stalled when I realised my moral issues with supporting sex work. I had this idea that I could make a place where sex workers get treated really well and if they wanted leave the industry, we could provide great support system for them.

- sex work is NOT empowering
- sex work can ruin multiple facets of your life
- sex work is not liberating. It traps you

> yes it's profitable...but at what cost?

sex work is much harder than people tell you it is to make more money than my brother does working in a cafe. Stripping and Onlyfans simply do not pay your bills. So you delve into doing things for money that you never imagined you'd do.

ohlala (startup for escorts) "has a mission to legitimise sex work"...i dont see it as achievable when its just another escort directory after all.

If you're currently a sex worker and reading this it will probably offend you that I am directly saying escorting is not empowering. I'd have to tell you its most likely you've never escorted before.

if you have escorted before and are still angry, I'd like to ask you

is this something you'd happily do forever?
do you need alcohol/drugs in order to do your job?
if you had a job offer from a company that paid the same as you earn in a month escorting. Would you stop escorting in favour of a 'normal job'
do you agree the benefits of money outweigh your own safety?
are you isolated from society with your work? do you feel lonely?
are you depressed due to what you do?
if given an opportunity to learn skills for running your own business, would you take it?
if you said no to all above I'd really like to hear your side of things, please drop me an email

Pia (founder of Ohlala) wants to make everyone into an escort, I'd rather create an alternative to escorting. What if you made enough online so you'd never have to see anyone in person?

where you can showcase your personality. Youve got so much more about you to share so do that, sell artwork youve made alongside your work, you hve the oppurtnity to branch out your income sources to not only sex work

#### What are the issues with the onlyfans type model?
people speak about the fact that with the boom in popularity of onlyfans, the chance of making real money has been significantly harder
my opinion is that the sex industry is clearly huge and it always has been, there are so many buyers. How about the idea that the subscription model alone is not enough?
in my own experience,
I'd get chatted to for hours on end and would feel uncomfortable giving someone so much more effort and time than other subscribers paying the same amount (pay per chat would've helped)
I got multiple people asking to buy used underwear (this was an annoying process to go back and forth and receive correct payment which had to be over paypal) (products for sale wouldve solved this)
some videos in the feed people are paying to see are further paywalls (I felt these shouldve been seperated as a video store)


#### Prior Ideas
These plans were written only 2 months ago yet I'm completely opposed to the ideas now. Did the branding before realising my true feelings on subject!

When attempting to shape the project I did a whole lot of research on escorts mainly through forums and reddit

### Idea 1: KYNK - a forum, knowledge base and blacklist

This one actually got built! on Wordpress (lol those were the days...) this was a year ago

The idea in short is a work phone that screens clients for you.

#### Problem
- Bookings are done predominantly through Whatsapp, Snapcat and Instagram. There's no way to monetise or take bookings there, it's an awkward process
- Screening should be better, there's no screening for just 'unpleasant clients' and timewasters, clients could be flagged so others can avoid him
- Escorts need education on safety, info should be accessible from the app they use daily

#### Proposed Solution

1 - chat with extra powers

- charge per text
- charge per minute
- send locked paywalled content
- take bookings in a booking calendar

2 - inbuilt screening

a reporting system for dodgy agencies, bad producers, nasty clients
A database of clients (like ClientEye) I made a mockup of a system where you could leave feedback about a client to other escorts to see if they recieved a call from the same client. It would say if he was a little dodgy or if there was an issue when it came down to payment.
gives escorts more power in choosing who they want to see,
clients would have to act better a they know theyre being rated too

3 - a knowledge base

teaching people to escort safer, learn vital things of how to run their business, all the stuff I didnt know and had to learn trial and error beforehand.


Want to see how my 'genius idea of contacting sex workers directly through their work phones' went?

<img src='/img/fail.png'  width='600px'/>



I entered private Facebook groups and posted there, only to be banned from the group within hours. People would click the link to the lander only to come back to Whatsapp with paragraphs of critque.

### What did I do wrong?

In my public post that went into the FB group, I wrote that I had 'been a sex worker in the past'. That statement distances me from the group I'm trying to connect with immediately.
This was a big critique they had as only people 'currenlty working' were allowed into their communities.

I wrote opinionated things in the knowledge base
I was highly highly criticised for the definitions I had added, one for "escort" and another for "prostitute" and so on. Defining in a tone that made the latter out to be a negative. Also, I wrote in such a way to edcuate the sex worker on how to become a 'high class escort'. I'd go into depth about why agencies are a scam, why being independent would be better than working in brothels...and so on. People don't like to be told they're wrong!

I was way too emotional about the topic
I got into a text conversation with someone that turned into a debate. She worked in a brothel and I had written that brothels take half your money, she told me how the benefits outweighed the cost for her situation. Also how dare I tell her her work is not 'valid'.

I cried in the bath that night. Hilarious looking back now but at the time I simply could not understand why, with all my good intentions the feedback had been so very awful? Why couldn't they see that I was just trying to help?

If I really wanted to help, I could've built a chairty or something
So after a year went by I learnt about decentralised web and for some reason I completely forgot about KYNK and thought I'd try again? (not good idea, weeks wasted, output is a blog post)


### Idea 2 - A humanising escort directory

Traffic from directories is how most escorts are able to run their business at all however, most escort directories are like a dehumanising candy store of naked bodies to choose from. adultwork.com is a prime example of tacky pink, dated and cemeneted in making SWs into products not individuals.

This directory would resemble classified ads like this and you could hover over the ad to see images. Idea being the clients can browse ads in their area on a SFW interface, favourite some accounts and message them later


<img src='/img/classified.png'  width='600px'/>

classifiedads
It would take a lot of the headache out of the process and become an 'agent replacement' as it handles advertising, booking , screening, etc. A lot of these processes could be automated
Each person would have a profile that also had their own store, feed of posts, tip jar, bookings calendar
Features for escorts
a great personal profile with customisation and area to talk about who you are, pictures, videos, tips monthly subscriptions, all on your profile page
adverts that humanises escorts, it's less about looks and more about personality first
Provide a booking and screening form for clients to fill out before the ability to message you is unlocked
add a booking calendar to your profile to let clients book time slots without the need to call
A chat with ability to send locked photos and take payments and many things
keep and tag a list of contacts you have seen, add notes for other escorts to anonymously warn of bad behaviours
Features for clients
real SFW browsing
'favourite' accounts and have a list of favourites
use a booking calendar so there's no need to call
get verified and attach your profile to reviews escorts leave about you
Problems for me building a directory
do I really want to build something for an industry that is harmful to people long term?
if I build an escort directory, I'm allowing + supporting prostitution, I cannot support (on moral ground) escorting as it has long term mental health implications for its participants
if I set out and make a good product, I'm actively promoting sex work as a viable income stream, maybe people who didn't consider it before would join because of me
people get around verification systems often, underage users have been known to try to use Onlyfans and many pimps & agents are running the adverts you see on directories.
0 investors are going to be okay with publicly funding something like this, I have no choice but to crowdfund or hide what it is which sucks.
I'd have to have a huge amount of traffic coming through to have people even wanting to use the site, I'd have to be at top of search results for areas which would be near impossible
I'd never be able to guarantee the following about any advert:
that its not a pimp/agency profile
that the sex worker is not being forced into posting there
someone could get assaulted using the app, or worse they could get killed

PinkDate - Describing itself as the "Uber of escorting," This one is not loved
Smooci - the 'uber for escorts' apparently this app is loved by escorts

others are scams run by blackhatforum users
Lesson - you dont need a community of creators. You need a monetisation model for the individual to have a direct relationship with their customers and supporters


### Idea 3 - The Sex Worker's App Chæi / Lattë / Athena / Rhea 

I was determined to have a stupid name wasn't I? ha. Was trying to go for a goddess warrior sorta name. Or just straight up a coffee but with cool letters

<img src='/img/landersw.png'  width='600px'/>

/about-us

Hello! thanks for checking out Lattë, here's a bit about us and what the company is about 😺

> Sex work is something that a huge percentage of people participate in, whether they had a sugar daddy or became a pornstar, to everything inbetween. It's an addictive world that can be hard to leave. I believe that if you give full control of the business to Sex workers, there's a far higher chance of better treatment and with the ability to save their money on blockchain, ability to get out again.

Sex workers are in need of a place to call their own online, a website you have full control over, you own it & nobody can take it away. It is a personal site for a sex worker to run their business under their own terms Stop working on apps that ban you, get on the app that supports who you are and your hustle.

#### What sex workers want
- to be seen as human beings
> Our job is part of our lives, but not the only thing. It doesn’t define us. We have hobbies, passions, friends and family. We are human. we are normal people

- to have full control of their work, freedom and control of their life.
> I've often found if the person has a website, an active social media presence, a blog, and they are engaged with others, it's a pretty good sign they are the one in the drivers seat.

- To be taken serious, seen as running a legitimate business
> I am free, as I am selfemployed I can pretty much arrange my schedule around my needs. I can take time off and I can work a lot. Compared to other jobs with similar entry levels I earn way more.

- consistent income source

#### Problems for sex workers
- can't take payments through Visa or Mastercard - must move to crypto but this isn't simple
- they get booted off centralised platforms (decentralised is answer)
- current online solutions are dated
- it is difficult to work independently, especially if new to the industry, this is why many go to agencies
- isolation, mental health issues, self esteem issues

> “We just want a platform to exist on that won’t rob us, or shut down one day without notice. That’s all we need,” Saira says. “I just want to be accepted, to be acknowledged, and to just be safe, and that’s where it starts.”

> “If you’re in a position to vocalize your support for sex workers, start there. If you intake the media, you should be supporting that media, and if you do it vocally, and enough people start to vocally support it, then it’s going to become a platform.” [Tyee]


#### Proposed Solution
Onlyfans x personal site x chat app x manyvids

a designated online place to run business from. To have your own site is super important. A place you own, you control, you can send people to, that can't be taken down
take down your website as soon as youre done with it / want a break from it
Take crypto payments direct to your metamask. No weird new coins you have to buy
have the resources and support a click away to get employed, learn skills, get on a learning path. (supportive community)

<img src='/img/ring.png'  width='400px'/>


#### Features
promoting your independence with your own page. Its completely about the individual that you are, you shouldn't have to rely on adverts on crowded sites. Direct your fans straight to your own page where there's no distraction

- personal website and domain, made on mobile
- set up monthly subscriptions to a paywalled feed (onlyfans / patreon)
- low fees!!
- accept crypto payments
- Knowledge base for safety information, help leaving the industry and learning new skills
- Made for sex workers who want full control of their online prescence

We would absolutely love to hear your thoughts and highly encourange any constructive feedback that you have. Please email



#### Why choose us??
Our mission is to help people become fully independent when doing sex work. There are a few core things we believe :

1. You shouldn’t have to give up a big percentage of your earnings
2. Your presence online should be respected, not taken down at a moments notice.
3. You should be completely in control of your work , when you work and leaving it
4. You decide who sees your page, what countries get access and who gets to message you

Individual, Independent, Supportive, Caring (main principles)
It's platform with the wellbeing of sex workers in mind
no fear of being kicked off, having your page shut down, it's decentralised
multiple potential income streams
totally transparent with team, where spending goes, how we make money, etc
effort put into branding of the site and personalised pages
opportunity to get on a learning path and be hired by us

#### Beliefs

the future for sex workers is completely independent people operating their own websites directing their traffic from social media to their own content feed and products they sell. (most successful stars have their own site with an onlyfans subsription model built in.)
Better online solutions could make a difference in the amount of people who choose online work over in person sex work (stripping, escorting/ working for brothel, agent, pimp)
There is a need for a company that shows its face proudly and stands behind supporting this group
People need education on how to stay safe and most importantly how to leave the industry.
I believe there is life after sex work, there's chance to help people achieve it if you're the platform they visit daily


##### Competitors - make a website

### Doing someting to help women that are like I used to be

Currently, young women are given this idea that objectifiying oneself all the time is totally cool because of the short term rewards it gets. This leads people to sex work, sugaring, stripping. If your worth is based in sex, you feel limited to these avenues It's also lead to a culture that you as a woman can happily put 0 effort in and get money in return

this movement is damaging to young women

nobody told me about the dark side of adult industry, selling yourself, the dark feelings that come with it. Because there's this massive lie on social media that it's super awesome to become a pornstar.

I had no financial skills so I was always falling into traps of managers and agents, I had no clue how to negotiate, so, people took advantage

I had to do a lot of things I didn't want to do, strip clubs don't let you go home early even though you paid to work that night, escort agents send people to dangerous clients as the client is 'too good a source of income to stop meets'

felt like my sole purpose in life was to please men

Then the worst thing is that once I decided to quit, I wanted to kill myself.

sex workers look to their future, and don't see one. and that's why they take their life

no chance of being hired at normal job again - addiction to the money
destroyed reputation
depression, anxiety, bad social skills
felt like all hope was lost and that I'd have to return to it again eventually
I want to make it cool to go into tech and be your own boss. Not cool to have 4k likes of a picture of your ass.

I am not sure how to do this as the short term financial rewards of sex work are so great

its the long term, the stuff you have to live with that sucks.
girls are putting too much pressure on upkeeping their looks, what are they going to do when those are gone?
I wanna help girls quit social media selfies and the addiction of vanity.
