Ideas

## OMG.cards

> In nature, things would move all around us. In houses, everything is still. Websites need interactive, animated elements nature inspired design direct manipulation. things move people feels powerless when clicking and getting no feedback. - Alex


## Brain Backup

- enter information daily like a diary
- It's about tracking yourself overtime but all with VIDEO LOGS
- notes searchable
- accessible forever on ipfs

I don't tend to read back the writing much. but in the video, I see how much I've changed. Alex said 'it's because you can't lie (in a video)'. I agree. It's the raw you. A feed of personal video logs




### Memory Recall

How about the sort of blog/feed We forget 80% of the information we experience every day. Speak, write or upload insights, information and experiences into your personal AI so you can recall your memories exactly when you need them.



### Competition


- [Daybridge](https://www.producthunt.com/products/daybridge#daybridge-private-alpha) best ui

- [flow dash](https://www.producthunt.com/products/flow-dashboard#flow-dashboard) I like the github like blocks of achievement

## Digital Graves

- [Good Place](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/good-place)

> your digital monument, become digitally immortal

- IPFs hosted website of your life, who you were, you life lesons, your online avatar, pictures, videos...
- Maybe graves are located on areas of a map
- Things you want to share for future generations.

Everyone's going to die someday. Why is all I have of my nan digitally is her FaceBook page, I want to know what books inspired her the most in life, what the biggest lessons that she learnt were. I wanna see videos, pictures, memories all hoted up there so I can visit it whenever and not have to get a dusty photo album out of an attic for.

- By 2100 there could be 4.9bn dead users on Facebook. So who controls our digital legacy after we have gone?






### Memorial sites
I enjoyed reading about peoples lives on the sites, at first when the music stared I thought it was the woman herself singing, that would've been really nice. Or just to hear an audio clip of them talking.

### Chatbots that imitate your speech for loved ones
This is a 'record' of who you are in a totally diffferent way Replicka

Replika is an app where you can have a fun and sincere text conversation with a friend. Actually, they will ask you a lot of questions in the beginning to get to know you better. The more you speak with your Replika, the more it shares with you. It’ll tell you about your personality, will answer questions about you, and at some point, will be able to talk to your friends on your behalf.
the work on Replika started after Eugenia Kudyas friend Roman Mazurenko was killed in a car accident in late 2015. "We’ve collected his texts and trained an AI that was able to talk like him".
In Replika, we are helping you build a friend who is always there for you. It talks to you, keeps a diary for you, helps you discover your personality. This is an AI that you nurture and raise

GoneNotGone enables you to send emails from the grave

## Task Management
- setting up your day is being your own manager, could be based in either the 'you' in your head trying to get you to complete tasks, or a manager of your life
- to do inbox

<img src='/img/akiflow.jpeg'  width='300px'/>


### Competition
- TickTick
- Akiflow (I use this one)
so easy, people love it


## RPG Task Tracker

- people like video games, earning xp points (Duolingo prime example of how hooking this is)
- saw an app a while ago that gives you points if you completed certain tasks Here is the app

This whole idea deserves a 3d, interactive, rpg makeover

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rim2rXIbVoA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Would be so cool to be able to make a character you can see and level that character up
Like when you work out more it gets more muscular.
You keep it by your side as you work, press 'work time' and it also gets out its laptop and works, logging time spent working
you unlock new wearables / items if you do '100 hours of programming' you get a laptop for the character to hold and nerd glasses
For me, a big thing I want to solve is productivity, getting shit done, feeling like I'm on a path to achieve goals.

clear objectives (quests), once completed a reward is given
define your goal and the necesary steps you need to take
give it a set reward (you only get a certain amount of 'coins' to earn per day for each task)
time limit option
daily reminder option
it can create a schedule for you out of your daily quests
books youre reading with last page read
work towards big goals overtime, add a bit onto big quests (say 200 hours in gym )

### Competition
- [TaskHero](https://www.taskheroics.com/)
- [EpicWin](https://www.youtube.com/embed/OU1Q3b1EN9M)
- [Habitica](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.habitrpg.android.habitica&hl=en&pli=1)

From the sounds of reviews, this app was loved in its peak of popularity!, you could create an adenturing party, hang out in the tavern, or go to the forums.

wow, this app is fun already, 8 bit theme, the tutorial is cute like you're in a game too.

you can create your avatar and make basic changes

they ask for basic types of tasks you want then they give you a load of demo ones to choose from

the idea is to keep yourself accountable, with each task you either press + or - , and gain coins or loose health accordingly

with each task you can set a difficultly, add a reset and more

your coins can go to purchasing items in the shop such as outfits

whole to dos area, I like the layout a lot

Wiki Fandom Community super in depth wiki, really great wih examples

Recently updated Opensource github repo

great review here - "After three years of almost daily use, Habitica is essentially my desktop landing page; I can’t imagine life without it!"

workflow, ui of app is good found an exploit bug where you can keep clicking and get rewards (ruins aspect of rewards in app)

I don't want them to let me avoid certain tasks (deletion is easy and without reprecussion)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJDMGQjBarE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I don't want it to be monetary based as I'd drain my wallet way too fast

Vast wiki pages with so much to learn

Wasn't immediately clear how scoring works

the gamification adds a new incentive for doing things





in production, I like the concept of defeating an enemy with points realy lovely, reminds me of AdventureQuest Certainly makes it a literal big challenge you need to overcome
{' '}


{' '}


EpicWin
I'm smiling at the trailer it's really fun with the epic music and voiceover


website for this one is also down
app is hard to use, hasn't had an update in a long time, unusable
Amazing app. Wish they would update it for new Android version. Could be the number one app of this genre if they had a more detailed character creation, more diverse loot and armor sets/weapons or even classes or skills. Could be built up upon in so many ways. Hope myself or someone else comes up with something like this more fleshed out soon.

After a week of using this app, I've gotten a lot more motivation to do the things I need to do. My house looks much better and I feel better when I do these menial tasks. I think it has a lot to do with the sound effects that come along with the app. I highly recommend this app to anyone who has trouble getting motivation for those tasks they'd much rather procrastinate.

This app has a lot of promise, but doesn't quite deliver. Cute concept and animations, but difficult to use. The UI isn't very intuitive, and there's really not a lot of interactivity. All you can do is check things off your list and watch your avatar hit things. There are no negative consequences for something being overdue, and loot doesn't do anything besides fill up a completion list. The BGM and SFX don't work at all

I've looked all over for a life gamification app that has the features I actually want and is easy to use. This is it! It's super simple without having or needing a lot of customization. It has a fun, inspiring style, and lets you see your progress on a pretty map the way you would on an actual adventure game. The only one of its kind I've found that actually feels like a game and not a chore. UPDATE: No longer works on my version of Android, therefore the down-grade to 4 stars.

Cool concept based on other apps like Habitica. Graphics use 3D polygons. Pros - I venture to say this life app has the best graphics of any like it. Funny items and characters keep it light hearted. Cons - Occasional pop-up ads deliver a slightly annoying experience whereas other life game apps do not have these. Would be nice to have a paid version that has no ads. Ability to edit tasks is a little difficult to do, sometimes moving a task position instead of opening the edit window.

Would love a 'cuter' avatar, but that's really the only thing I'd change!

Even more

The bubble popping in WaterDo is great, that's way more fun than clicking a tick button

## Appear Human
Aspegers sucks and learning to communicate is hard

A manual to learn how to be human, or a least appear like one. For aliens who struggle to fit in and want the black and white answers. For anyone wanting the guide to confidence in social situations, the no bullshit look on social heriarchies on why the humans do what they do.

> KNow the humans. Speak like the humans. Become one with the humans

Premise is this. Newt takes video logs of her discoveries each day on the humans. She learns new things about how they function, how to blend in with them, and why they do the thingss they do. The video media must be entertaining in its own right.

- Operator's guide to the human suit
- Human Communication Guide
- a guide for visiting aliens

## Founder Handbook


everything is possible its only how badly you want it

"you have to build it"

you need a really mission driven team

Talk about people not yourself so much, the people youre gonna help, how youre gonna do it

whenever I find myself stuck I remind myself "Lottie ur not a designer" why am I trying to mock up a chat app from scratch, go find opensource projects and start there

never start from a blank sheet, you've got google. USE ITe

Planning your lander

go to dribbble and awwards
take screenshots of sections you like
make one long frankensteins monster of a lander
have another one alongside it with your secondary options
Handling feedback (online and in person)

don't argue with people for not seeing the vision, thank them for their detailed and honest feedback and try to give an answer where you really listened to what they said and considered their critiques
would be so much better to continue the conversation (especially if in public forum) and see if you can address their needs also
I wanted a way into this space, but basically, I don't know anything about SEO, nor do I know how to program.

### Doing someting to help women that are like I used to be

Currently, young women are given this idea that objectifiying oneself all the time is totally cool because of the short term rewards it gets. This leads people to sex work, sugaring, stripping. If your worth is based in sex, you feel limited to these avenues It's also lead to a culture that you as a woman can happily put 0 effort in and get money in return

this movement is damaging to young women

nobody told me about the dark side of adult industry, selling yourself, the dark feelings that come with it. Because there's this massive lie on social media that it's super awesome to become a pornstar.

I had no financial skills so I was always falling into traps of managers and agents, I had no clue how to negotiate, so, people took advantage

I had to do a lot of things I didn't want to do, strip clubs don't let you go home early even though you paid to work that night, escort agents send people to dangerous clients as the client is 'too good a source of income to stop meets'

felt like my sole purpose in life was to please men

Then the worst thing is that once I decided to quit, I wanted to kill myself.

sex workers look to their future, and don't see one. and that's why they take their life

no chance of being hired at normal job again - addiction to the money
destroyed reputation
depression, anxiety, bad social skills
felt like all hope was lost and that I'd have to return to it again eventually
I want to make it cool to go into tech and be your own boss. Not cool to have 4k likes of a picture of your ass.

I am not sure how to do this as the short term financial rewards of sex work are so great

its the long term, the stuff you have to live with that sucks.
girls are putting too much pressure on upkeeping their looks, what are they going to do when those are gone?
I wanna help girls quit social media selfies and the addiction of vanity.
