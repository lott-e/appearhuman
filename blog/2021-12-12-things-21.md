Planned out the AppearHuman lander in Figma


<img src='/img/apphuman.png'  width='1000px'/>


with a tone similar to 'hitchhikers guide to the galaxy' in the copy

## Modelled 3D Newt my avatar

Some point between the 23 and 28th of December I decided for some odd reason to completely rebuild newt. Setting me far far back in progress. I fully switched the body. Don't know why

<img src='/img/newt18.png'  width='300px'/>


Tried to add some toon lines. Learned far too late on that these lines are generated in the viewport. Unity has a toon plugin I might try, will look for new solution for toon look.



### There were fails - Enjoy some fantasic bugs

## Human Handbooks

A collection of books, with a fun interactive site where you can pull one of those books off the shelf

<img src='/img/humanbooks.png'  width='800px'/>


### [Handbook](https://human-pi.vercel.app/) for people with Autism


<img src='/img/humanhandbook.png'  width='800px'/>


### Founder [Handbook](https://founder-handbook.vercel.app/)


A founder Handbook that never made it to light as I realised - how can I write a book on being a founder when I've never been one? lol?


<img src='/img/founder.png'  width='800px'/>
<img src='/img/founder2.png'  width='800px'/>


### Techie Handbook

Also I was building out a full frontend developer guide on foam.Before even being a Junior Developer, I set out to write a course as I learned!  

This was a difficult slow site to navigate.

### 3D in browser


This was difficult to understand conversion to .glb files and keeping poly rate low. Eventually failed as this procedure is limiting to low poly, extremely simple things.

## Made 3D icons for Munch
Icons for FaceMunch app made in Blender.


They did end up in the app only to be removed due to performance issues. the files were big and this kept being an issue. 2D is just faster

<img src='/img/icons2.gif'  width='230px'/>
<img src='/img/icons.png'  width='300px'/>

<img src='/img/icon1.png'  width='400px'/>


## Made Alien 3D social posts

These were really out there and arty. Based on Martin's fantastic instagram posts


<img src='/img/alien3.gif'  width='200px'/>
<img src='/img/alien2.gif'  width='200px'/>
<img src='/img/alen1.gif'  width='177px'/>




### Wrote FaceMunch Notion docs
I organised the internal Notion to be a Knowledge base for new hires, aswell as a place split by area to mark goals, progress, plan projects etc. This

There was a public part to send to investors, and a private half



## Sex Work Startups
some ideas based in making the lives of sex workers easier



> DO NOT do sex work

The project stalled when I realised my moral issues with supporting sex work. I had this idea that I could make a place where sex workers get treated really well and if they wanted leave the industry, we could provide great support system for them.

- sex work is NOT empowering
- sex work can ruin multiple facets of your life
- sex work is not liberating. It traps you

> yes it's profitable...but at what cost?

sex work is much harder than people tell you it is to make more money than my brother does working in a cafe. Stripping and Onlyfans simply do not pay your bills. So you delve into doing things for money that you never imagined you'd do.

ohlala (startup for escorts) "has a mission to legitimise sex work"...i dont see it as achievable when its just another escort directory after all.

If you're currently a sex worker and reading this it will probably offend you that I am directly saying escorting is not empowering. I'd have to tell you its most likely you've never escorted before.

if you have escorted before and are still angry, I'd like to ask you

is this something you'd happily do forever?
do you need alcohol/drugs in order to do your job?
if you had a job offer from a company that paid the same as you earn in a month escorting. Would you stop escorting in favour of a 'normal job'
do you agree the benefits of money outweigh your own safety?
are you isolated from society with your work? do you feel lonely?
are you depressed due to what you do?
if given an opportunity to learn skills for running your own business, would you take it?
if you said no to all above I'd really like to hear your side of things, please drop me an email

Pia (founder of Ohlala) wants to make everyone into an escort, I'd rather create an alternative to escorting. What if you made enough online so you'd never have to see anyone in person?

where you can showcase your personality. Youve got so much more about you to share so do that, sell artwork youve made alongside your work, you hve the oppurtnity to branch out your income sources to not only sex work

#### What are the issues with the onlyfans type model?
people speak about the fact that with the boom in popularity of onlyfans, the chance of making real money has been significantly harder
my opinion is that the sex industry is clearly huge and it always has been, there are so many buyers. How about the idea that the subscription model alone is not enough?
in my own experience,
I'd get chatted to for hours on end and would feel uncomfortable giving someone so much more effort and time than other subscribers paying the same amount (pay per chat would've helped)
I got multiple people asking to buy used underwear (this was an annoying process to go back and forth and receive correct payment which had to be over paypal) (products for sale wouldve solved this)
some videos in the feed people are paying to see are further paywalls (I felt these shouldve been seperated as a video store)


#### Prior Ideas
These plans were written only 2 months ago yet I'm completely opposed to the ideas now. Did the branding before realising my true feelings on subject!

When attempting to shape the project I did a whole lot of research on escorts mainly through forums and reddit

### Idea 1: KYNK - a forum, knowledge base and blacklist

This one actually got built! on Wordpress (lol those were the days...) this was a year ago

The idea in short is a work phone that screens clients for you.

#### Problem
- Bookings are done predominantly through Whatsapp, Snapcat and Instagram. There's no way to monetise or take bookings there, it's an awkward process
- Screening should be better, there's no screening for just 'unpleasant clients' and timewasters, clients could be flagged so others can avoid him
- Escorts need education on safety, info should be accessible from the app they use daily

#### Proposed Solution

1 - chat with extra powers

- charge per text
- charge per minute
- send locked paywalled content
- take bookings in a booking calendar

2 - inbuilt screening

a reporting system for dodgy agencies, bad producers, nasty clients
A database of clients (like ClientEye) I made a mockup of a system where you could leave feedback about a client to other escorts to see if they recieved a call from the same client. It would say if he was a little dodgy or if there was an issue when it came down to payment.
gives escorts more power in choosing who they want to see,
clients would have to act better a they know theyre being rated too

3 - a knowledge base

teaching people to escort safer, learn vital things of how to run their business, all the stuff I didnt know and had to learn trial and error beforehand.


Want to see how my 'genius idea of contacting sex workers directly through their work phones' went?

<img src='/img/fail.png'  width='600px'/>



I entered private Facebook groups and posted there, only to be banned from the group within hours. People would click the link to the lander only to come back to Whatsapp with paragraphs of critque.

### What did I do wrong?

In my public post that went into the FB group, I wrote that I had 'been a sex worker in the past'. That statement distances me from the group I'm trying to connect with immediately.
This was a big critique they had as only people 'currenlty working' were allowed into their communities.

I wrote opinionated things in the knowledge base
I was highly highly criticised for the definitions I had added, one for "escort" and another for "prostitute" and so on. Defining in a tone that made the latter out to be a negative. Also, I wrote in such a way to edcuate the sex worker on how to become a 'high class escort'. I'd go into depth about why agencies are a scam, why being independent would be better than working in brothels...and so on. People don't like to be told they're wrong!

I was way too emotional about the topic
I got into a text conversation with someone that turned into a debate. She worked in a brothel and I had written that brothels take half your money, she told me how the benefits outweighed the cost for her situation. Also how dare I tell her her work is not 'valid'.

I cried in the bath that night. Hilarious looking back now but at the time I simply could not understand why, with all my good intentions the feedback had been so very awful? Why couldn't they see that I was just trying to help?

If I really wanted to help, I could've built a chairty or something
So after a year went by I learnt about decentralised web and for some reason I completely forgot about KYNK and thought I'd try again? (not good idea, weeks wasted, output is a blog post)


### Idea 2 - A humanising escort directory

Traffic from directories is how most escorts are able to run their business at all however, most escort directories are like a dehumanising candy store of naked bodies to choose from. adultwork.com is a prime example of tacky pink, dated and cemeneted in making SWs into products not individuals.

This directory would resemble classified ads like this and you could hover over the ad to see images. Idea being the clients can browse ads in their area on a SFW interface, favourite some accounts and message them later


<img src='/img/classified.png'  width='600px'/>

classifiedads
It would take a lot of the headache out of the process and become an 'agent replacement' as it handles advertising, booking , screening, etc. A lot of these processes could be automated
Each person would have a profile that also had their own store, feed of posts, tip jar, bookings calendar
Features for escorts
a great personal profile with customisation and area to talk about who you are, pictures, videos, tips monthly subscriptions, all on your profile page
adverts that humanises escorts, it's less about looks and more about personality first
Provide a booking and screening form for clients to fill out before the ability to message you is unlocked
add a booking calendar to your profile to let clients book time slots without the need to call
A chat with ability to send locked photos and take payments and many things
keep and tag a list of contacts you have seen, add notes for other escorts to anonymously warn of bad behaviours
Features for clients
real SFW browsing
'favourite' accounts and have a list of favourites
use a booking calendar so there's no need to call
get verified and attach your profile to reviews escorts leave about you
Problems for me building a directory
do I really want to build something for an industry that is harmful to people long term?
if I build an escort directory, I'm allowing + supporting prostitution, I cannot support (on moral ground) escorting as it has long term mental health implications for its participants
if I set out and make a good product, I'm actively promoting sex work as a viable income stream, maybe people who didn't consider it before would join because of me
people get around verification systems often, underage users have been known to try to use Onlyfans and many pimps & agents are running the adverts you see on directories.
0 investors are going to be okay with publicly funding something like this, I have no choice but to crowdfund or hide what it is which sucks.
I'd have to have a huge amount of traffic coming through to have people even wanting to use the site, I'd have to be at top of search results for areas which would be near impossible
I'd never be able to guarantee the following about any advert:
that its not a pimp/agency profile
that the sex worker is not being forced into posting there
someone could get assaulted using the app, or worse they could get killed
Competitors
adultwork - 89th most popular destination in the UK
155th most popular adult site in the World
AdultWork.com membership currently stands at over 4 million, with over 250,000 logging in every month.
eurogirls starterstory
PinkDate - Describing itself as the "Uber of escorting," This one is not loved
Smooci - the 'uber for escorts' apparently this app is loved by escorts
ohlala
others are scams run by blackhatforum users
Lesson - you dont need a community of creators. You need a monetisation model for the individual to have a direct relationship with their customers and supporters


### Idea 3 - The Sex Worker's App Chæi / Lattë / Athena / Rhea 

I was determined to have a stupid name wasn't I? ha. Was trying to go for a goddess warrior sorta name. Or just straight up a coffee but with cool letters

<img src='/img/landersw.png'  width='600px'/>

/about-us

Hello! thanks for checking out Lattë, here's a bit about us and what the company is about 😺

> Sex work is something that a huge percentage of people participate in, whether they had a sugar daddy or became a pornstar, to everything inbetween. It's an addictive world that can be hard to leave. I believe that if you give full control of the business to Sex workers, there's a far higher chance of better treatment and with the ability to save their money on blockchain, ability to get out again.

Sex workers are in need of a place to call their own online, a website you have full control over, you own it & nobody can take it away. It is a personal site for a sex worker to run their business under their own terms Stop working on apps that ban you, get on the app that supports who you are and your hustle.

#### What sex workers want
- to be seen as human beings
> Our job is part of our lives, but not the only thing. It doesn’t define us. We have hobbies, passions, friends and family. We are human. we are normal people

- to have full control of their work, freedom and control of their life.
> I've often found if the person has a website, an active social media presence, a blog, and they are engaged with others, it's a pretty good sign they are the one in the drivers seat.

- To be taken serious, seen as running a legitimate business
> I am free, as I am selfemployed I can pretty much arrange my schedule around my needs. I can take time off and I can work a lot. Compared to other jobs with similar entry levels I earn way more.

- consistent income source

#### Problems for sex workers
- can't take payments through Visa or Mastercard - must move to crypto but this isn't simple
- they get booted off centralised platforms (decentralised is answer)
- current online solutions are dated
- it is difficult to work independently, especially if new to the industry, this is why many go to agencies
- isolation, mental health issues, self esteem issues

> “We just want a platform to exist on that won’t rob us, or shut down one day without notice. That’s all we need,” Saira says. “I just want to be accepted, to be acknowledged, and to just be safe, and that’s where it starts.”

> “If you’re in a position to vocalize your support for sex workers, start there. If you intake the media, you should be supporting that media, and if you do it vocally, and enough people start to vocally support it, then it’s going to become a platform.” [Tyee]


#### Proposed Solution
Onlyfans x personal site x chat app x manyvids

a designated online place to run business from. To have your own site is super important. A place you own, you control, you can send people to, that can't be taken down
take down your website as soon as youre done with it / want a break from it
Take crypto payments direct to your metamask. No weird new coins you have to buy
have the resources and support a click away to get employed, learn skills, get on a learning path. (supportive community)

<img src='/img/ring.png'  width='400px'/>


#### Features
promoting your independence with your own page. Its completely about the individual that you are, you shouldn't have to rely on adverts on crowded sites. Direct your fans straight to your own page where there's no distraction

- personal website and domain, made on mobile
- set up monthly subscriptions to a paywalled feed (onlyfans / patreon)
- low fees!!
- accept crypto payments
- Knowledge base for safety information, help leaving the industry and learning new skills
- Made for sex workers who want full control of their online prescence

We would absolutely love to hear your thoughts and highly encourange any constructive feedback that you have. Please email



#### Why choose us??
Our mission is to help people become fully independent when doing sex work. There are a few core things we believe :

1. You shouldn’t have to give up a big percentage of your earnings
2. Your presence online should be respected, not taken down at a moments notice.
3. You should be completely in control of your work , when you work and leaving it
4. You decide who sees your page, what countries get access and who gets to message you

Individual, Independent, Supportive, Caring (main principles)
It's platform with the wellbeing of sex workers in mind
no fear of being kicked off, having your page shut down, it's decentralised
multiple potential income streams
totally transparent with team, where spending goes, how we make money, etc
effort put into branding of the site and personalised pages
opportunity to get on a learning path and be hired by us

#### Beliefs

the future for sex workers is completely independent people operating their own websites directing their traffic from social media to their own content feed and products they sell. (most successful stars have their own site with an onlyfans subsription model built in.)
Better online solutions could make a difference in the amount of people who choose online work over in person sex work (stripping, escorting/ working for brothel, agent, pimp)
There is a need for a company that shows its face proudly and stands behind supporting this group
People need education on how to stay safe and most importantly how to leave the industry.
I believe there is life after sex work, there's chance to help people achieve it if you're the platform they visit daily
