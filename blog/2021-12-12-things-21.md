## Modelled 3D Newt my avatar

Some point between the 23 and 28th of December I decided for some odd reason to completely rebuild newt. Setting me far far back in progress. I fully switched the body. Don't know why

Tried to add some toon lines. Learned far too late on that these lines are generated in the viewport. Unity has a toon plugin I might try, will look for new solution for toon look.



### There were fails - Enjoy some fantasic bugs

## Human Handbooks

A collection of books, with a fun interactive site where you can pull one of those books off the shelf

### Founder Handbook

A founder Handbook that never made it to light as I realised - how can I write a book on being a founder when I've never been one? lol?

### Techie Handbook

Also I was building out a full frontend developer guide on foam.Before even being a Junior Developer, I set out to write a course as I learned!  

This was a difficult slow site to navigate.

### 3D in browser


This was difficult to understand conversion to .glb files and keeping poly rate low. Eventually failed as this procedure is limiting to low poly, extremely simple things.

### Game for Appearhuman.com

I wanted to make a remote controlled newt so I could explain concepts and drive the newt round the page.

Use your arrow keys to move newt

## Made 3D icons for Munch
Icons for FaceMunch app made in Blender.


They did end up in the app only to be removed due to performance issues. the files were big and this kept being an issue. 2D is just faster

### Wrote FaceMunch Notion docs
I organised the internal Notion to be a Knowledge base for new hires, aswell as a place split by area to mark goals, progress, plan projects etc. This

There was a public part to send to investors, and a private half

### Drew some things
