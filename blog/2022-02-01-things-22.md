### Twerk Break - Editing a music video 

this took about 3 days. Went with a dated look as all detail is lost when you invert the color. Ended up not using more than half the footage, focusaed on introducing each girl one at a time and then showing the group together at the end. I wanted it to reflect that this is about people getting together and having a good time.

## Built a 3D avatar called Newt

This was supposed to be the speaking face of appearhuman.com but then I realised I have a face! And mainly that realtime mapping of facial movement isn't possible on my laptop.

I learned how to use Blender, Unity and Rokoko.
