# Why improve anyway?

Self improvement is something we should all strive to do, every day. People struggle with traditional goals as once they are achieved, the motivation is gone. What we want to do is completely transform ourselves into the dream version of ourselves. You'll be suprised at what is possible if you really put the effort in

> Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one. ― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

> Self-improvement is the improvement of one's knowledge, status, or character by one's own efforts. It's the quest to make ourselves better in any and every facet of life.

Develop the habit of learning from everything, the last meal you cooked - what changes would make it taste better next time? where did I miss the mark this time? Or in social situations, take note of what is going on in the conversation from a birds eye point of view. Take a mental note of when your delivery was off and the joke didn't land.

Don't wait til next year, start planning right now for starting tomorrow. Why not? If we push aside our goals and don't develop routines to complete them, how are they going to be completed? (they aren't)

> No one awakens in the morning, looks in the mirror and says, ‘I think I will repeat my mistakes today’ or, ‘I expect today I will do something stupid, repetitive, regressive and against my best interests,’” writes the Jungian psychoanalyst James Hollis. “But frequently, this replication of history is precisely what we do.

## 1. Firstly we need to start with a self awareness of what we do every day.
Take note of the clock... Do you game 2 hours a day? do you play on your phone for 2-4 hours a day?

Take a deep and honest look at yourself and think about your negative traits, things that make you unhappy that you did them such as loosing control of your emotions and saying nasty things you can't take back.

## 2. Then we need to map out what it is we want to achieve.
Seriously these can be as outlandish as you like, if you want to be a famous rapper, the joureny has got to start today
although obviously if you're short you most likely be able to become an NBA player
Ask yourself, what exactly is it that you want to improve? Consider setting SMART goals to help yourself achieve these goals more easily (Lawlor, 2012).

SMART goals are: S - Specific M - Meaningful A - Achievable R - Realistic T - Trackable

For each area of yourself that you want to improve, see if you can come up with a clear SMART goal and a method for how you will track and achieve your goal. It's also helpful to think about how each goal fits in with your values and your desired future. Ask yourself, does each goal fit with who you are and who you want to be?

### 3. With our goals in mind, we can work out what is necessary to put in place to start schieving these goals

How about you? What's your plan? To set yourself up a plan, ask yourself these questions: How will you break your goal into achievable steps? How many of these steps can you complete in a day, week, or month? How will you track your progress? Is your plan realistic and doable? What will you do if you can not accomplish a step of your goal when you planned to? (i.e., when will you complete that step? Or, what's your plan B?)

## Controlling the brain

> Your brain wants to control you. If you can't contorl your own brain. And your brain controls you. You're fucked.
> you gotta tell your brain where you wanna go and how you gonna get there
> You've got to control it, if not. It's over. - [David Goggins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLKxdTmk-zc&ab_channel=MotivationMadness)

my new norm is that wow this isn't always fun. It's not always meant to be fun.

Realize how the brain works. You need to be like "brain, we are doing this" and brain says "roger that".

> I'm not gifted, I'm just driven. Anybody's capable of doing shit like this. - [David Goggins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLKxdTmk-zc&ab_channel=MotivationMadness)
