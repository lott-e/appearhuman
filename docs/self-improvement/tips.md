> The more you get pushed, the thicker your skin, trust me, the higher you go - Gordon Ramsey

always offer people around you things first

> Although he was clearly dying, he still offered Sean the doughnut and tissues first. Proper bloke. - (he was eating hot wings in video)

when getting water, get it for everybody, again serve them first

learn to speak about people with respect and grace

intently listen when people speak to you. Recalling something they said at a later date is magic, they will notice.

## Talking to people
look people between the eyes when you get overwhelmed
smile, make an effort to socialise
there's no rush to reply, pause for a moment, slow down.
be proud of yourself for making small jumps in socialising
it gets better every time you practice!
remember, you're not disabled, you're just different and awesome. It's on you if you let it get you down. Love being different, it's so much cooler than being 'normal'
be okay with the fact you have aspergers.
oversharing is uncomfortable for NTs, similarly to how you feel uncomfortable being touched, its suddenly too personal

## Truth
Most people don't care for 'truth' in general conversations, it's far easier to just agree with them than to go into a big debate. Say someone says a fact and you know it was and you want to correct it right now -- is this of enough importance to point out? -- how helpful is my opinion to them?

often people want to moan to someone about their problems, theyre not looking for a solution -- tell them what they want to hear!

DO NOT give opinions unless DIRECTLY ASKED

-Be mindful of others feelings but don't waste time trying to impress them.

-Unless you are around people you know you can trust, don't share more than necessary

-When someone asks you if you like something important to them (their clothes, art, photos, food, etc) don't answer with a simple "no" if you don't. I usually focus on the small positives instead of the whole thing, example: -friend: do you like my dress? -me: the color is beautiful and it makes you look taller (i might not like the dress, however i can find things that are nice about it and that will sound like a compliment) Other example: -Friend: did you like the movie? -me: the special effects were really good and the actors did a great job! (Again, this isn't a yes or a no, but something in between that will make them feel like you liked/appreciated the thing

-personal experiences as an answer to vents/bad events in other peoples lives is not appropiate. It might feel like the most genuine way to express sympathy, but to them it feels like you are making their problem about you, or telling them "I had it worse, grow up"

## Important / new conversations
When you have to have an important conversation take a few moments before to think. Work out what are you trying to do, then consider your audience. What might upset them - what do they like, does any of that relate to what you are trying to accomplish with the conversation. If you can consider what might be a problem you can know in advance to avoid those possible issues. So consider your goal, what to avoid, what to include (likes that are RELEVANT), and what you are trying to get - and you can work it out like a map. It takes practice but you can do it alone often to get in the habit

when I smile at people I put extra effort in making the outer edges of my eyes crinkle. it makes people believe that my smile isn't just polite, it's genuinely happy (it isn't) but people respond really well to it!

Anything complex or too big - break it down till you can handle it. For example I have a large collection of books and comics. The idea of organizing all of it is almost laughable. But I have started on this mythic task. How - I broke it down. I am starting with my graphics and started to separate them based on publisher at first - Marvel and DC and then indies, all the Marvels about fill my office. I am slowly now going through the Marvel collection and starting with a first sort based on alphabetical. Then I may do it by character / team. Is it all done then, hell no, but part of it will be.

How to figure out something new - I come across stuff all the time I have no clue how to do it. So if I can't find someone to do it I will figure it out. How is simple - research. For example I wanted to figure out how to make a item from Starbucks at home. So I looked it up, looked at the methods used and the went and figured out how all those worked and I did that via reading websites and watching videos. Then I looked at several different ways of making the item I wanted to make so see what consensus was, is there some way someone else might do it better? Then I got some supplies and started to try to do it.

Getting things done - lot's of people post about issues getting things done or keeping up with things. The simple was I found was when you start you take time, like above, break it down till you can figure it out. For example - I HATE doing laundry, pain in the ass, but it has to be done. So to get it done I worked out a system to make sure I got it done.

all dirty clothing / towels / sheets all go in 1 place

laundry is sorted - colors / whites / linens and towels

laundry is started on Sat and done by Monday - every other week

check laundry before going to bed, nothing wet left in washer over night and anything not dry in the dryer is started

check laundry in the morning, first thing

So there are a few, I can add more if there is interest. Also feel free to add yours, or ask for tips to do something.

Whenever you really can't make a specific choice: pick a coin or a dice according to the number of favorite options and flip/roll. Then, give yourself one minute to explore how you feel about the result. If you feel slightly happy it's probably the option you would have preferred, if you feel slightly unhappy you probably don't like the option that much, and if you feel nothing in particular the choice probably isn't that important to you so you should simply go with it.

Was just writing this in another thread. Our brains incredibly overcomplicate things, so we have to create systems to adjust. For cleaning-related tasks (or to do lists) do them in chunks according to "type/category". When our brains get into a "groove" of a certain type of task (such as making icky phone calls) its best to keep that groove going as long as you can because once you stop it is so hard to start again.

If you want to improve your strategies, head on over to our cousin subreddit r/adhd â€“ we share many brain functions as they do, and that's a much larger community always talking about efficiency, staying focused, staying motivated.

## Masking
Phrase all criticism and advice as a question. All of it.

Most people get overwhelmed by too much information all at once. If you have a concept that you need to explain more than a couple of times, come up with a short summary.

Give them the teacup first and then ask if they want the firehose.

If you have a clarifying question of any sort, disclaimer with 3-5 words exactly. Longer comes across as anxious and shorter as rude. Consider reiterating your disclaimer or adding self doubt at the end of sentence if your question in any way contradicts what was meant by the other person.(Ex. "Sorry, I don't quite understand. Wouldn't that mean ___? Maybe I'm drawing the wrong conclusion.").

If you are musically inclined, stim in a repetitive fashion, or have Perma background music stuck in your head, you can use it as a time keeper for eye contact start and stop times. Just don't change too often and mix it up a bit so they don't realize.

If you are far enough away, you can look at the inside or outside corner of the other person's eye to avoid eye contact sensory issues (Do not attempt up close, they will be able to tell).

Dance, Psychology, and Theater classes supposedly do wonders for helping you mask convincingly when you need to.

Sharing personal anecdotes is not an appropriate way to express empathy, no matter how much it feels like it is. You can still share them, but your first 2ish responses should be sympathy/condolence based and/or asking follow up questions and allowing the other person to keep talking. After that, a short personal anecdote does help establish empathy.

Every 2 paragraphs of speaking/typing, stop and redirect to the other person with a question. Allow subject changes at these points and, if they happen, don't go back to your topic if you can avoid it.

-When you're telling yourself sth along the lines of: "Maybe i should set a reminder for this [thought], or i'll forget about it in 5 min.", set a reminder that bloody instance. Don't even finish what you were doing, because you will also forget to set the reminder in 5 min. Same goes for: "Maybe i shouldn't be pouring salt out of the 1 kg pack, or i won't be able to control it." or "Maybe I should park my car one block over, this slot looks way tiny."

Your first instinct is almost always right. Don't go against your own judgement.

I started typing out a list of things, but I suppose my tips mostly come down to figuring out the minutia of life, which is hard for a lot of people not just aspies. Try to finding that balance between being self reflective and learning from your mistakes without being overly critical. It's tricky and takes time especially with our black and white brains.

Our faults are pointed out to us more often than most, and we may try to overcorrect them. I try to take time to map things out on a spectrum, and find that the ideal solution is often somewhere in the middle. For example I used to be very loud and shared too much, which wasn't appreciated by most, I ended up overcorrecting and became extremely quiet and reserved. The ideal solution would be somewhere in the middle of those two extremes, and even though it takes a long time to reach that middle ground, being aware of it is helpful. Of course try not to be overly critical of yourself, that's also a spectrum between overly critical and completely unaware, again the best outcome is somewhere in the middle.

One thing that helps me is trying to rephrase rules in ways that better make sense to me. For example throughout school I was told to "Treat others as you would want to be treated", my black and white brain wanted to be treated really well, and so treated everyone else really well without focusing on myself. I've since changed that rule in my head to "when possible, don't treat others in ways that you wouldn't want them to treat you" it's pretty much the same but makes more sense to me, and leaves room to take care of myself.

I always ask myself how i would feel if someone said the thing im about to say to me. It works most of the time in filtering out things that will offend or harm.

## Habits
When I'm in the danger of locking myself up too much in my own antics, (eating the same few sorts of food, listening the same few songs, doing the exact same routine each and every day), which may be bad to my physical, mental health or reputation, I think back to the days when these habits were formed, and start thinking of the current days as ones that could be similar.

First, it reminds me that my current habits weren't always here, turning seemingly constants back to variables, other than that, it reminds me that new things might be so good for me that they are worth being developed into a habit.

## Home
If you just say "I" all the time, people won't want to be around you
Blaming someone else, whining. Don't expect people around you to care.

Quietly get along with your life, you'll be liked by others.

Talk more, a few extra words could make a great impression

Don't stay with what you know
We tend to settle so quickly with what we see as comfortable

Admire other people
Find the ability to give.

## Give ZERO FUCKS
Take (calculated) risks - don't be afraid to fail

College is not the answer, it isn't always the best
Slow down & enjoy life, slow your roll
Be open minded and try new things.
Start saving for retirement early.
Think about the things your passionate about and pursue it.
Give to others... be willing to help.

> Every problem I've created for myself boils down to my failure to set good expectations and/or meet the expectations that have been agreed upon. When I truly internalized that â€” and started forcing myself to have uncomfortable conversations to make sure expectations were clearly set my whole life changed for the better

> itâ€™s not what happened, but how it happened in relation to what was expected that determined how people felt about the outcome.

Be honest with yourself.
Can you actually hit that deadline, or are you saying what you think people want to hear?
Do you actually want to commit to this opportunity, or are you just afraid of losing it?
