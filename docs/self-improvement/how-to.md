How to learn
Elon's 2 rules for learning anything faster
> “I think it's important to view knowledge as sort of semantic tree. Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e., the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details, or there is nothing for them to hang on to.” - Elon Musk, on Reddit

Make sure you're building a tree of knowledge
understand how and why something works the way it does
Connections power your learning
you can't remember what you can't connect
connect your learning to your base knowledge


## How to solve the problem?
Can you solve this for me? A : it depends, please give me more information

"imagine" the steps of solving the problem in your head

break it down in to logical small steps

The smaller and easier the tasks the smoother the project goes
write that into code

there are no clear set rules of how something should be done
there are tools and frameworks to help you make a contextually good choice


### How to learn programming
think of something you want to build and begin building it

Personally, I have a handheld notebook that I keep beside my computer. Each day I write tasks I want to complete today.

I've tried online things, tried to keep a calendar in Notion but for some reason handwritten notes just do it for me. It's a nice notebook too, not random pieces of paper.

It allows me to easily see progress of amount of tasks I can get done in a day, also easy to plan for tomorrow.

Many people don't succeed in learning programming
This is true for a few reasons

people end up in tutorial hell
I thought it was b$ until I could follow a tutorial and make a cool marketplace...but when asked to write a function without help? I'd want to cry. That's what is meant by tutorial hell, you're stuck watching tutorials like they're life support.
my theory is that it's because you're blindly following yet not actually understanding -why- that thing was put there, -why- this was done and not -that-
It's very important to understand why you're doing things and you learn by doing, absolutely...but you remember things by understanding how they work and why they work the way they work. - metalandcoffee

how can we avoid this?

don't get discouraged
learn to type without copying everything from tutorials
Make sure you understand what you're learning with challenges:

Codewars
challenges
Be okay with having a hard time
it's going to be difficult, don't let it get you down
the worst thing you can do is just sit there and stress
embrace the struggle
Got a subject you need to learn? watch 3 different youtube channels. Watch once, watch the next ones on double speed on confirm and contrast information

Helps to hear same information repeated in different ways

## How to Google
put your search inside " " for exact matches
only from a particular site? site:fireship.io react hooks
site:url search term
exclude some results?
same as above followed by minus that term →. -jquery
certain date
after:2020


## How to plan projects
The steps to take to start solving problems...

identify

identify and understand the nature of the problem
make a problem statement Context
we must merge 600 pull requests issue
it would take days to click the button manually why do i care?
it will save us millions of dollars
research and refine

google it, research what others have done to solve the same problem

you're likely not the first one
make sure you confidently understand what the code does before using it
discuss issue with other devs

can this api help me?

you should have by this point broken the main problem into lots of smaller problems

pseudocode

write outline for how e will implement code
focus on logic, not syntax
name things as exactly the problem they solve
test-driven development //Jest

understand what tests wil be valuable for that feature
implement

Done is better than perfect
reflect

reflect on the code
Starting projects
Starting from templates can go really bad, you dont have an understanding of how the whole thing works. use templates as your guide for sticking new things into your own app.

### How to improve your code
improve readability by naming things better
add comments
remove duplication
optimise time/space complexity of algorithms
add error handling

## Get shit Done Today
Got 7 hours get something done and wasted five of those on one task? YOU FAILED.

Reminder. You're under a deadline.
do not waste time that you do not have
Why should you?

you don't want to be left feeling dissatisfied with the day and how much you’ve accomplished
you want to feel like you're taking a step towards your goals everyday
You do not need to wait for the 'perfect idea' to hit you out of thin air, nor do you need to wait for a great moment of motivation. You need to firstly ge good at just getting up at a good time, sitting at the computer, planning your day and getting that shit done.

> Making observable outcomes of your work is your primary goal.

Let's start with how to get up in the morning and spring out of bed ready to get shit done. First, find your reason you want to start waking up early

you WANT to wake up early. You'll have a longer day, you'll get more shit done. You want this.
you WANT to become a founder. Building a startup is going to take a lot of dedicated, productive hours of every single day
you WANT a ROUTINE. Don't kid yourself that you'll find time, you won't it must be planned into a routine you stick to
you WANT to tick off todos and get more shit done
don't use your phone as an alarm clock

do not pick up your distraction device the moment you wake up
a. buy a dedicated alarm clock b. do not set multiple alarms, train yourself to respond properly to the first alarm

Do not use your phone before sleeping

the blue light makes it more difficult to get to sleep
it will effect your quality of sleep
unplug your phone charger from your nightstand, put it into another room
Do not pull late nights!

sleeping at 4am every night isn't going to help
random wake up times make you groggy
Wake up at the same time every morning, even on the weekends

this helps your internal body clock wake you up a the right time
a. but I'll only get 2-3 hours of sleep if I sleep at 4am

why are you up so late?
you should not be pulling late nighters all the time
Have a plan for when you get out of bed.

get up, brush teeth, pee,
get ready for workout (headphones, phone, mat, music on)
shower, get dressed
get the coffee started, make the bed
Prep the night before

make it as easy as possible to jump out of bed
towels ready before you shower
prep your outfit
figure out what's on the to do list for your day
clean up, declutter your bedroom
drink water

accomplish something within the first hour of waking up

say positive things to yourself in your mind

### Organising your Schedule
“Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.” - Gustave Flaubert

clean your room, organise your life
get a routine, get up at the same time every day
go to bed at the same time
establish disciplined habits
How to increase stability by decreasing instability: -Decrease neuroticism by increasing conscientiousness. -Organize life with traditional/conservative values.

Ways to increase conscientiousness:

Clean room.
Organize life.
Get a routine.
Wake up at the same time.
Go to bed at the same time.
Establish disciplined habits.
Use a schedule (Hold to your schedule not rigidly like a tyrant but consider it as a confidant and adviser.)
Design a 7 day week.
(Expanded) Schedule items that:
Are meaningful and productive.
Make life feel justified.
Make progress towards goals daily.
Discipline.
Note: Daily progress, made easier with habits and discipline, adds up over time, especially a lifetime.

Schedule


### How to use a schedule

use Google calendar
Don’t use Google Calendar as a tyrant; you should use your calendar as if it’s your confidant or advisor. Sit down, open your calendar and design a week of days that you’d like to have, schedule events that you would consider to be meaningful and productive on a daily basis so that you feel that your life is justified by having a day like that.

The goal should always be to make progress day by day rather than falling further behind which you can accomplish through establishing disciplined habits.

### Planning the day
“Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do.”

#### Commit to a goal
“Deliver Results”

### Daily Life
ask yourself, what could I do to make this thing better? your brain can figure these fixes for you once you start asking it questions

work out ways to make the things you do daily better

There are two ways to do something: Right and Again.

always put things back exactly how you found them the moment you are done with them

Don't rely solely on your brain to store information

things fade when you don't use them
notebooks need to be digital, backed up, and safe.
easily accessible
easily searchable
label everything

organise your bookmarks

Raindrop.io helps to makes very quick bookmarks
understand your life dependencies

I need vitamins, to shower, to eat healthy... daily...
two is one, one is none

this is about keeping backups of the important things you use daily. Such as extra memory cards on hand or remembering to buy two milk cartons for your coffee rather than the one (easily the one runs out)
if his thing not existing is going to interupt your schedule, you need a backup of it
organize by experience, not dogma (how other people do things)

question the established ways people do things
do things as effectively as you possibly can
Working environment
Mise en Place - everything has a place it belongs to. Everyhing needs to be organsied for you to use it
you cannot work in chaos
incredibly important in the kitchen as you need clean surfaces and to know where everything belongs
once you're done, put everything back exactly where you found them
How to write a first draft
don't procrastinate;
review the notes and renew the literature search;
determine who your audience is - most likely reviewers, so get their concerns firstly addressed;
create the outline and get the big picture done, i.e., complete the first draft while resisting the temptation to correct and edit as you go; the logical sequence of data/tables/figures may be the outline; while writing the first draft, take notes indicating what references might be needed and would be about, but don't stop to collect the references;
begin with the easier part of the task - experimental section rather then the introduction; then follows the results and discussion section;
then comes the really hard part - critical editing where you make sure that the English is coherent and the science is correct;
write the conclusion in a numbered format;
then comes the abstract and the acknowledgements;
now comes the introduction, the two most important things to address in which are the purpose and relevant background;
then collect the references.
Some final notes:

always check the manuscript requirements for the journal of interests.
a few references on writing. Please refer to the video.
