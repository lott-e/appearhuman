Learning should be a thing you do daily. I'm saying this because I've realised I tend to learn the bare minimum for everything. Then my skill level stagnates. My work imporves only by trial and error.

If you just learn cooking like that...never know, maybe there's better ways of using the knife, maybe you dont understand some fundamentals, maybe the knowledge of food paring is needed. Or cleaning even, maybe you do that in a way that could be vastly improved. For everything you do in life, strive to do it well.

I realised I have this part of my brain that doesn't care to be the best at something, mediocre is fine to it. We gotta fight that part of the brain

So, how? well firstly pros of any given field are on youtube and blogging about how they got where they are. Let's go there Literally Googling "Learn (Blender) Roadmap, everything I need is there.

  we live in a time right now where you can hear the experts opinion in seconds
  thanks to Youtube. The best teachers in the world are there, go find them, go
  listen to them. Don't waste this valuable resource. Remember, you don't know
  shit. yet.
Keep at the top of your roadmap the thing you need to create, it's he reason we are even putting effort in at all.

## Why you should learn something new everyday
> All the jobs I’ve had I did it just for the money. Mindless work, the only challenge was grinding. Not actual achievement. Same with school. Falling in line with academia just because it’s what my family wanted. Pretending to enjoy computer science. That never panned out and I quit my job and became a plumbing apprentice. Everyday I learn something. I learn a SKILL that I can take with my anywhere. Not something that gets lost at a singular job. What I’m doing now applies to life not just money. I feel accomplished, I feel challenged, I feel like a human being and a man.

This comment sums it up well. Learning makes you feel like you're levelling up all he time, because you literally are. Can't cook? LEARN. Can't clean up the house? LEARN. can't make websites? you get the idea.

Learning is exciting when it is to do with a subject you like, for me it's 3D skills to make a vtuber

### Success Formula
Show up. Most people don't show up.
Play. Stay curious. Trade your cleverness for bewilderment
Information + Emotion = Long Term Memory

### Deliver results

It is easy to be fooled into thinking being busy equates to results. What actually matters are the outcomes of our work

Changes to your routine
In my experience routine helps our brain. We aspies think more than normal people (not because we are better or something but because we have to process showing and identifying emotions on a conscious level) so anything we can do without thinking is welcomed

just to decide on stuff at least a day in advance.

Sudden changes suck but I know it will be vastly worse if I don't suck it up and deal with it.

I keep living - it happens all the time for me

a routine must be aligned to your future goals , otherwise you wnt see the point in doing things

OK, so something I noticed is that a fear of uncertainty is a big thing with people on the spectrum. Fear that you won't be able to deal with something unknown that comes up.

The trick is to actively put yourself into situations repeatedly where the outcome is unknown. But start with things where even if it all goes wrong, the consequences don't really matter. For example, eating something different for breakfast. Going to a different restaurant for lunch. Driving a different route to work.

And it kick-starts your brain into thinking in different ways (because you have to navigate new terrain), which means you come up with new ideas.

What I do is break my routine frequently. Yes, you suffer through the anxieties and fears, the thing you’re trying to avoid. But then you do it again and again. Overtime your anxieties and greats will diminish with each repetition. Don’t expect them to disappear. They will just become reduced to a level where they’re manageable and routine. Some instances may cause them to blow up. In those cases, you’ll have a little more confidence to face the challenge and work through it

wish I had someone telling me what to do when.

"Desperately need routine but it's impossible to keep it"

time blocking
I'm having a hard time setting up a structure and routine for my everyday life, everything from making food and cleaning to engaging in my hobbies.

Does anyone have tips to share about how you structure your days? What kind of routines works for you? How do you make yourself stick to the routines even when you don't feel like it?

Any advice is really appreciated!

a) get distractions of any kind as far away as physically possible: phones, books, games will always end up destructing you, especially if they are in your eyesight while you work (if you can, definately get someone else to take them away while you work)

b) create timetables, as neat and detailed as you can (the neater and more detailed, the more I feel like starting a task, I have no idea why). Planning to do a task at a more specific time, e.g 2:47 rather than 3:00 can also stop you from putting off tasks

c) organising your work space, another weird thing that for some reason helps me concentrate so much better. I think it just feels more refreshing to sit down at a clean, neatly organised desk than one covered with junk

d) reward yourself when all your tasks are finished, but DO NOT reward yourself/take breaks when there are still more tasks left, I can promise you it will be completely impossible to get back to what you were supposed to be doing, and even just 'one episode' or '5 minutes' can quickly end up wasting your entire day.

I hope this list helps you, I am also scheduled for appointments to an occupational therapist which should hopefully be soon, so I should hopefully be better at combating this kind of thing by then if you need more tips

"I don't just like routine and I don't just thrive on it, I need it in order to think and function."

I am still struggling with the main routines (eat, sleep, wake up). But for the micro level stuff I need to do, I will always do to do-lists!

I have one for work, one for private life and one for groceries

I use a checklist everyday for literally everything. But sometimes i do it out of order as long as i do everything on the list. Would it help you at all to do this at work and include a list item for being called to clean a specific mess, then at the end of the night if you arent disrupted you get to cross it off anyway?

A lot of autistic traits make it difficult to just live your life and that's annoying. Like a sudden change to your routine and it makes anxious and you want to cry. what if I told you there's a way to control your emtions and be okay with changes to your routine?

You just have to want this to be the case

To get something done today you're gonna have to start creating a good routine. Many people live solely to their routine, it gives people comfort and stability.

You managed to stick to your school routine as there would be reprecussions for not attending a class. So you need to make something a little similar for yourself, except you have to be the headmaster of your own school.

You're going to make a routine because you have set some goals and you want to achieve those things

a handheld notebook is best to have beside you all the time

its purpose is to be efficient as possible and finish tasks

My written routine holds me accountable for getting shit done. Everyday I write a list of what I'm going to do today in each hour long time slot

you're probably bad at keeping track of time
hourly or half hourly slots are easiest to handle (you don't need to check the clock every few seconds)
Routine examples
Every single day there are a couple things that need doing - wake up, eat food, shower, clean up.

Wake up at a good time (early) in the morning, this allows you to get more stuff done in your day. Wake up late and you'll be groggy and tired all day

09:00 wake up and get ready / workout
Eat something that is going to give you energy for the rest of your day

if cooking breakfast - tofu, mushrooms, eggs, salmon

if quick breakfast - museli, milk

10:00 eat food

11:00 - 14:00 work

Weekend

Don't fuck up your good sleep schedule for the weekend

Changes to the routine
Well this can hurt a lot before rying to chnage your reactions, you're going to learn how to become unreactive to changes. Learn to compromise to change.

Don't look at change as a scary, anxiety provoking notion. Frame it as exiting.

How to clean your bedroom
just begin do not think about beginning

bring hoover to the room, you'll need it later

remove items that do not belong in bedroom and put near door

dirty clothing should be thrown into pile on floor by the door

get things off the bed and make the bed

change sheets if been more than 3 days or if they smell

making the bed isnt about perfection, get creases out of bottom sheet,

put pile of clothes back onto bed (leave space for folding)

fold clothing and put into seperate piles

Marie kondo technique

once all clothing folded put away neatly

hoover floor

wipes clean surfaces

move faster! you do things so slowly and your time should not be wasted!

Sleeping
Sleep was something I barely had for a long long time, it would be the main reason I couldn't wake up in the morning.

work/learn enough during your day to be exhausted by bedtime
Weekly Routine
I keep a daily planner and list of longer-term projects and chip away at it slowly.

Routines/Executive Functioning

executive dysfunction

Apps to make your routine with
I made reasons to want to do the tasks. I want a clean and neat house every day because it makes me restful inside of me. Most tasks add to this actually. Not doing the tasks is worse for me then doing them.

I clean my house to have order and rest

I take a shower in the morning because it gives me a nice clean feeling

I do my chores so I don't have that nasty feeling I stille need to do them

I excercise because it makes me feel healthy My biggest insight: Be your own purpose ;-) I deserve to be treated good by myself.
