### what to argue about

When not to argue
I started this never ending row with a Christian guy over indian food, the other two people at the table..


align with their set of beliefs

show them you're like them too

plant the seeds of doubt

make them question their own beliefs

yes thta's true i agree, you know whats interesting? (insert belief)

### Debating

STAY CALM. Do NOT overtalk the other person

Newman (the female interviewer) is trying her hardest to trigger a bad response out of Peterson, but he does not allow it
She takes what he's said in the past and generalises it, its up to him to define the truth o these statements (because they're on live TV)
Peterson stays very calm, he's a calm wall, he keeps the power in this conversation. He does not llow her to trigger emotional responses from him
He avoids arguement, holds himself back from saying extra things he shouldn't
