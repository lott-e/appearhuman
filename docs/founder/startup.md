# What is a startup?
Startups
The concept of entrepreneurship is a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty

building a startup is an exercise in institution building; thus, it necessarily involves management

a startup is an experiment with a theroy you're trying to test

The Lean Startup asks people to start measuring their productivity di4erently. Because startups often accidentally build something nobody wants, it doesn’t matter much if they do it on time and on budget. The goal of a startup is to )gure out the right thing to build—the thing customers want and will pay for—as quickly as possible.

Glossary
Some key terms and a short description of what they are:

Mission statement
What is the purpose of your company? What is the larger mission it has in society?

Values statement
What does your company value and why?

Vision Statement
What is your grand vision for this company? If you could do everything you want with the help of a genie granting you a wish, what would your ideal version of your company be?

Experiential goal
What is the experience you want to bring to people? What does that experience look like? Feel like? Is it a cheap and fast experience to make people not stress about money and their time? Is it a high end, luxurious experience to make people feel superior or like royalty?

Culture statement
What culture does your company represent and promote? How does your values, mission, vision, and experiential goal all fit into this and support this culture?

Elevator pitch
A very short description of your company, product/service, who it is for, and why they (will or do) find it valuable. This is something you should be able to recite orally in the span of 30 seconds--just enough time to pitch it to someone in an elevator as you stuck together waiting for the doors to open

Product specifications
This is a very comprehensive document that outlines every feature in your product. It outlines each feature, goes into great detail about what that feature is, what its purpose is, how it relates to other features, and how it supports the overall purpose of the product/service in delivering a specific experience and benefit to the user/customer. You could think of this as a script in movie production.

Wireframes
These are rough visually mockups of your product. In software, it is a mockup of a screen. It shows the layout and all the UI elements on the screen. Complete wireframes depict every single screen. Each screen may have many versions. Each version shows how each UI element could appear to the user. Complete wireframes are arranged to show userflows. Wireframes do not need to be perfect. They just need to be good enough to demonstrate what you want to build and how it should work. Everything in this gif could be considered a wireframe up until the gif changes to the finished 3D animation in color: . As you progress through the process the wireframes will slowly become closer to what the finished product will look like.

Userflow
This refers to the path a person can take while using your product. It is a step by step map that follows a specific process. A userflow may show each step of first loading up your application, show them register an account, and end with them landing on the dashboard screen. It may continue on to show them use your application to get the benefit you promised them. It may only show the process of trying to create a password, getting an error, and trying to make a new password correctly.

Userstory
The userstory tells the story of who a particular user or customer is, why they are searching for the benefit you are offering them, and why they would accept your offer. It could be a summary of who they are in regards to their demographic and psychographic profile. It could be very detailed and include a lot of contextual data behind every aspect of that profile, going a few levels deep.

Prototype (clickable if software)
A version of your software that does not actually work. It is more of less a slide show that is interactive. You create an invisible link on an area of an image. Clicking that specific link takes you to a very specific image. You can click these links to follow a userflow to demonstrate how your product would work if it existed. It is used to test and validate your assumptions before actually spending immense time and resources building your software before you start to get valuable feedback from customers or users of your software.

Business plan
This is classic. It's much more for helping you stay focused. It serves as your own personal guide to grow your business. It is a living document and should be updated as you test your assumptions and learn from those tests. It doesn't need to be a big document. It should be pretty short when you first start. All the other documents you create will be added to it as you go. If you decide to get a loan from a bank this will serve as the foundation for a formal business plan that a bank will require.

Go to market strategy
This is your strategy of how you will bring your product to market and monetize it. In other words, how you will make money. Who you are marketing to, how you will reach them, how you will convert them to a sale. This usually only focuses on the first two years and often is broken into phases.

Market research
All your research on the market you intend to enter and sell products or services to. It should include historic data, trends, and a summary of where you see the market going and how you intend to seize an opportunity there.

Competitive research
All your research on your competitors. This isn't only exclusively focused on other companies. Your competitive research should also focus on alternative means to obtain the same benefit you are offering to people. For example, a note taking application is not only competing with other applications. It is also competing with physical products like Moleskin or Sticky Notes. Think of all the ways a person can obtain the benefit you are offering them, how they obtain it, and who they are. Different groups will seek benefits in different ways. Old people vs young people, rich people vs poor people, social conscience people vs greedy people, etc.

Pitch deck (for partners, customers, investors you'll use essentially the same basic slides and interchange others to tweak the story to fit the audience)
A pitch deck is like a business plan. It is just a much more visual and easy to digest version of one. It functions like a power point slide show. The purpose is to tell the story of who you are, what you are doing, who it is for, why you are doing it, how you intend to do it, how you intend to make money by doing it (if not to customers), and an ask or call to action. That ask depends on the audience.

Mentors
People that are willing to give you free advice and free support. They usually have no formal commitment to you. You should never feel entitled to anything from them. This relationship is informal and closer to a friendship than anything else. You get more out of it the more gratitude and patience you show. You also attract more mentors when you yourself participate as a mentor in your community.

Advisors
They are very similar to mentors. The only difference is that they are formally committed to you. This is a business relationship. Advisors are often provided a small amount of equity to fulfill the role of advisor. This equity should be vested (not given all at once). They have a responsibility to support your company. They are often very strategically chosen to bring your company both credibility and invaluable insight.
