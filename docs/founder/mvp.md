# MVP
You need to have more than just an idea. You need to demonstrate that you are a leader and the visionary. You need to bring tangible things to the table.

You might want to start by doing this:

Step 1

produce a lean business model canvas

create the draft of your business plan (mainly just the executive summary)

mission statement

values statement

vision statement

product vision

Step 2

recruit mentors

conduct user research

conduct user interviews

conduct competitive research

map user flows of competitive products and alternatives

define user stories

run initial validation tests

Step 3

core assumptions

devise your monetization strategy

go to market strategy

more validation tests

Step 4

product road map

features outline

product specifications

more validation tests

update your business plan

Step 5

MVP outline

produce wireframes of key screens and most critical user flows

run more validation tests

update your business plan

Step 6

produce complete wireframes of every screen showing every possible state each UI element could be in, and show the complete user flows

run more validation tests

update your business plan (should be fairly complete)

Step 7

produce a clickable prototype from your wireframes

recruit co-founders

recruit advisors

Step 8 - variations here depending on your situation

shop your blueprints around (product specifications, wireframes, user stories, user flows) to devs to get estimates and prices...choose one and get the MVP built

utilize your blueprints to raise investment capital, secure grants, or pre-sell the product to fund the development--then do the above line item

if you have the ability/team to build internally and without outside capital, get to work building your MVP, following your blueprints, with confidence you are building a product the market actually wants and you know how to reach them and sell them it, and that you have a solid foundation for how to operate it

Step 9

Build a real business around your MVP

Here is another workflow (there are many different routes to arrive at the same destination) to be more than just an idea person:

Identify the main goal and purpose of the company

Identify the main product that supports that goal

Research what people use currently to meet the goal you are after

Outline the basic features for your product

Research what other services/applications exist that may approach unrelated problems in a similar way to how you want to approach meeting your own goal

Refine your product outline

Prioritize your features by which ones are absolutely necessary to create a beneficial and supportive experience towards the overall goal of your company and product

Create an outline of your business plan and strategy

Create wireframes, product specifications, and user stories that clearly express how you plan to execute the build-out of your product based upon all your research, goals, and strategy.

Create your business plan, strategy, and product road map

Create simple validation tests using your wireframes that fit the context of your product specifications, user stories, and strategies.

Shop your blueprints around for estimates from dev shops and/or co-founders to fill those roles you can't do on your own

Create a pitch deck

Shop your pitch deck around for investors

Get stuff built, run tests, learn/adapt/pivot as necessary in order to generate traction

Growing an actual business starts here

At some point you will want to form a proper company. LLC or S-Corp. Speak with a CPA to understand which and when.
