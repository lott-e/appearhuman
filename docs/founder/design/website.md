# Great design that encourages people to take action

There are three fundamental parts to any great design

### 1. Leading the users attention
The ability to lead people around the page

We make people look at what we want them to look at when we want them to look at it
We want to tell a story
rollover animations, especially those that have a delighted effect on user are great
the more positive your customer feels, the lower the cognitive load, the more positively they'll view your website

### 2. Creating compelling calls to action
how we make sure users see them and click on them

your main CTA should be not be high on the page but into the main column instead

use a primary colour to attract attention to the CTA

bigger is better

3. Keeping the user engaged with aesthetics
Keep the user informed the whole way along the journey, tell them what's going to happen next. They need to be given a full understand of what's going on so they are confident in their decision to click the CTA

Humour
adding humour to the brand is sometimes a great thing to do, only use it where it's appropriate though
avoid a comical 404, the user is frustrated don't make a joke of it
Testing
add user session tracking to see how users naviate your site
use Hotjar on your website
Fixing issues
find a problem to address
diagnose the exact problem
test potential solutions
Google Analytics
make a list of the top pages people are leaving the site from
look at your bounce pages (people leaving the page within 20 seconds)
Most decisions humans make are ilogical, emotional ones. When browsing a websie, we are usually on the lookout for dangerous situations such as avoiding giving over personal inforamtion. The 'fear of missing out' is triggered often by websites that use phrases such as 'almost gone', '3 people already added this to their basket', 'expiring soon'....phrases such as these are called Dark Patterns

we make many descisions unconciously

There are two systems the brain has for making desicions.

```md
System 1 => fast, intuitive, emotional, automatic, guessing.

System 2 => concious, effort driven descisions
```

> We are lazy thinkers and favour system 1

### Dark Patterns
[DarkPatterns](https://www.deceptive.design/) is a website made to expose these dark patterns
people really hate manipulative dark patterns, if you use them on your site, people will 'put up with them' and definately notice them. They'd rather these tricks not be there at all though.

Customers will come to realise they've been manipulated and will write bad reviews if you lie to them, so don't.

Don't make me think
Its doesn't matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice - @skrug

We don't read pages, we scan them - @skrug

The 4 pillars to conversion
1. Address objections and reduce risks head on
[Paul Boags newsletter page for conversion](https://boagworld.com/subscribe)

your email sign up should be clear on why you want their email and what the benefit will be to add the email.

deal with all objections and concerns at the call to action

make inputting their email a risk worth taking

This is the footer of Boagworld. Lots of reassurance here, knowledge of what you'll get, so many ctas

  > Focus on benefits to them before speaking about features
reframe their thinking

Here is Convertkit comparing their feature set to Mailchimps this reframes the thinking from price comparision to feature comparison
appeal to the selfish gene

appeal to how the buyer or reciever will feel after buying this
a person with this would feel...you could help...

always keep the user informed on what is going on

give people control

give people the ability to undo mistakes

2. Defeat Cognitive Overload
The search box should always be in the top left corner. It's a rule because most of the websites people have used before followed this rule. Put your search in the footer and now the person has to go on a mission to find it.

  Big companies like Amazon and Apple have done all the thinking for you on
  converting websites. Don't try to be too different. Follow the known
  guidelines and principles
Your website cannot feel like hard work, grouping related things for instance can help users remember where to look to find the button they are looking for.

3. Establish trust
want people to do anything? you must establish trust
be open, honest and transparent


This blog post from Flickr is a[ great example of honesty](https://blog.flickr.net/en/2005/07/21/sometimes-we-suck)

Always address the person reading your site as 'you'. Afterall it is one person reading the site. Youtubers make the same mistake, often addressing their audience as 'you guys' or 'team Jared'. This always alienates me, the single human watching it. Address the viewer directly and you're talking to them personally.

trust can be established by using more personlaised, human language

social proof really works, however, people can be untrusting of it

make your social proof more trustworthy by adding links to quotes and embedding tweets directly
don't remove negative comments, reply to them if you can and listen to the constructive critique
have a large number of reviews showing if possible
use social media to show you're someone worth following
use authentic videos and photos. Avoid high quality flashy, stock photo esque shots
build a community
Word of mouth recommendations are incredibly powerful, social media, discord groups, open discussions help with this.

Tell a story
Tell stories about....

your customer
your customers
your products
your people, the team
Performance impacts conversion
For every 2 seconds of load time

4.8% loss in revenue per visitor
3.8% reduction in clicks
1.8% drop off in queries
performance matters more than your stupid graphic/ video background/ 20 different fonts!

44% of shoppers will share a bad experience with friends
How to improve your site performance
speed up imagery with tools like Sirv
use a content delivery network
optimise css and javascript
watch web font sizes and other package sizes
If it undermines conversion, get rid of it

Prioritise making the site great for mobile users
there should always be something moving at every section of your page, a small icon, video or Lottie animation will do
