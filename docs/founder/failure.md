# Failure

Avoiding Failure
you're not making what people want
you don't find a way to scale

> ðŸ¦„ most ideas aren't meant to be unicorns ðŸ¦„

[Startup Graveyard](https://startupgraveyard.io/?ref=producthunt)

You've probably heard that you "should never give up on your dreams", though this is quite a dangerous statement to take seriously. The 'not giving up' mindset is not helpful as in reality we know that most startups do fail.

> The grim reality is that most startups fail. Most new products are not successful. Most new ventures do not live up to their potential. - The Lean Startup

This link is pretty interesting and helps put failure into perspective ->timeline of careers and failures of founders

a unicorn has a very specific set of attributes

a company that garners a valuation of 'x' amount of money
you have to convince a bunch of people to value you company at thats- its a benchmark of success, validation of the market...
ultimately the 'unicorn' is just a badge
Why startups fail
allure of a good plan, a solid strategy,and thorough market research.

startups operate with much uncertainty

### Learning to give up
realise that sometimes we're wrong
choose whether to pivot or persevere
What failure teaches us
Failure is an important lesson to learn, it teaches us that:

how our product thesis might have been wrong
how our market approach might've been wrong

A startup is a thesis made up of three variables:

1. Audience / Customer
2. Pain point / Problem
3. Product / Solution Hypothesis

It is an assumption that this group of people have this problem and their solution is this product / service you've come up with.

if you're wrong about one of these statements, you have to pivot

## Pivoting
"a startups runway is the number of pivots it can still make" - The Lean Startup , Eric Ries

be willing to question the product
be willing to change direction fast
have a regular feedback loop

### Signs there's a problem with your hypothesis
you have low conversion
customer compliants
high churn

### Slidebean Case Study
they went from being a general "Presentation Builder" to a "Pitch Deck Builder". They found better product market bit with founders, however the TAM (total addressible market) was tiny. Smaller still when specifiying ones that would need a presentation builder:

founders looking to raise venture capital
that aren't comforable using powerpoint
that don't have a graphic designer
it's too small of a group to power a unicorn

They kept pushing and adding new features, new marketing hacks, but failed to see growth.

So, they tried to make something new

they tried "Advocado", a similar concept to their slide creator but instead it was an advert creator. After putting a trial video up onto Youtube they saw little engagement. They realised they were not in a good position to tackle that market so they gave up. They went on to build FounderHub, a startup checklist guide on the steps you have to follow if you want to raise capital. It has a couple 100 active users, however they never found a way to monetise.

Then they ended up making Youtube content

They started to focus on Three new Axis

their consulting branch,
this came after they realised that people were not in search of a deck builder, they needed help from human beings, writers and designers
this can be priced accordingly to the startup coming to them for advice
its also an ongoing solution, people will always want advice but want to build their deck only once or twice (then stop their subscription)
Recurring
they made an advert themselves

a note on this advert, there was no need for the founder to be in this video

Comments -

"I'd urge you to reshoot the video with actual actors and not the staff itself."

"Oh Caya is in it?"

I think it's important to note that if you're the public face of your brand, people are going to decided if they like YOU or not and then whether they'll use your product.

Slidebeans New Direction

you send your invoices to a provided email address, they'll classify your tools, track monthly changes, warn you of any issues, let bookeepers know what tools actually are, get rid of duplicates....saving you a lot of time and money
recurring keeps track of your monthly subscriptions, and a bunch of other things
  "We figured we should build Recurring because we ran into this problem
  ourselves, and we tried a few products and none of them seemed to target
  companies like ours." - Caya CEO
this new problem was one they had experienced themselves whilst building their prior projects
3 - a new direction for slidebean is that is will become a suite of tools
