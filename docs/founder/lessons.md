# Founder Lessons

Focus
only one of your projects can be the main priority
all your free time should be poured into learning about the space, the market, how to build, and of course building your project
Don't try to solve a problem you don't care about
there's a high change of losing motivation to continue working
don't just choose a problem you think will work
Define Customer Persona
Know your customer super well
Solve Onboarding
customers need to know what your product is for and how to get started with it
Pricing
put a lot of effort, deine your strategy on pricing
look at competitor pricing
Focusing on adding more features rather than refinement
make the existing functionality resonate with people
A startup is not a small business
It is a phase and not a type of business. It is the phase during which founders aim at finding and validating a model that scales repeatedly, usually by leveraging technology. Startups are built for growth and it is for this main reason that most startups are tech startups; reaching more people through technology. Small businesses, in the other hand, execute proven models rather than search for one such as owning a restaurant, barbershop or a grocery store. From a business and revenue model perspective, small businesses are ahead of the curve.
Team
Build a great team
Most startups fail not because they have a flawed business idea, but because the executive team is weak You can’t run a business entirely on your own, or at least not for long. Building a talented and successful team can help you achieve your dream. Know what you do well, and find others to work with you who complement your strengths and strengthen your weaknesses. You might be able to create the most amazing product, but if you don’t know how to sell that product, you don’t have a business. Build a team that works well together, respects you as a leader and shares the same passion for achieving success.

Implement better training and processes for your product
streamline the training of your team
Power & responsibility: generating expectations in users and investors is a great power that comes with great responsibility. Anonymity and proximity: The thing that made your company grow can also destroy it if you don’t evolve. Change the rules of the game: Listen to what your customers want and give it to them, but don't pivot so much that they don't recognize you or identify themselves with your product. Bad press: if they are talking about your company, it’s fine, but if they associate it with negative situations all the time, well, it isn’t. When the press talks about your product, act as soon as possible. Grow with your audience: It's fine that you focus on your customers, but think about how you can continue to be relevant to them. Especially if they are college students, who will soon graduate and go home.

As everyone says, ship product as soon as possible
Start selling as soon as possible (Lifetime offers are a great start)
Build-in public, share your process and achievements (books for help: Steal Like An Artist and Show Your Work by Austin Kleon)
Engage with others on Twitter, make friends!
What’s the best way to motivate other people?

> Make them feel special. Create an esprit de corp, and a feeling that you are an elite, that even if you have the shittiest jobs within a large  organization, you should feel proud of the fact that you’re part of something. Recognize excellence. Celebrate weirdness, and innovation. Oddballs should be cherished, if they can do something other people can’t do. But also everybody needs to understand that there are certain absolutes; there is a certain line. That no matter how much I love you — you may be my favorite, but if you show up late, two days in a row, I’m sorry — but you’re going over the side.
