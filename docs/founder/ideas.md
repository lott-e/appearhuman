# Coming up with good ideas

Finding ideas is an endless struggle, until you start looking at yourself and what problems you have First, pick a niche and start talking with your target audience. Just to throw something out there, have 20 phone conversations with your target audience. Until you do that you'll have no fucking idea what the product needs to do for your customers.

you have to want this to existin the world

you need a purpose, a core, a belief

Make a list of key words relating to subjects you're interested in and know a bit about eg -ecommerce, video sharing, wellness

### Get into some new habits

start brainstorming new ideas every day, write them down
Read TechCrunch for latest news in tech and startups
See what other people are creating on ProductHunt
Check HackerNews People posting ghtere are experts in their field.
Don’t read the articles, instead look to the comments, read the high rated ones and understand point being raised.
The Show tab is where people show off their side projects, find open source gems here
use the Search option on these sites with your keywords also
Reddit startup pages are not all too helpful, too many morons, too hard to find good information

Market Research
Market research is the gathering of information related to consumer’s needs, tendencies and desires.
Researching your market will help you define your future niche within your industry, and ultimately, should guarantee that you maximize your profits.
it is better to start with market research before writing a business plan

make markets that are growing the topic of your interest, don't just pick stuff you're interested in right now...unless that's a growing market, then good news! - Alex

### Market Research
Don't fall into the trap of just guessing what will work. Remember, you know nothing, go read and learn.

### Confirming Beliefs about a markets
Who is my TARGET MARKET?
Is my product idea in DEMAND?
How much are people WILLING TO PAY for my product?
You're an entrepreneur. NOT an inventor. STOP trying to reinvent the wheel or coming up with unique untested business ideas.


pick something that excites you - you need an emotional investment in what you're doing

write out ideas every day

naturally, nobodys going to be interested in your idea, the world couldn't care less. You have to persuade them

Next, follow the lean startup model.

Build (your minimally viable product. Don't be a perfectionist because you're scared of the next step.)

Test it. (validate it in the market. Do people buy it. Measure)

Pivot. (is the idea shit? Pivot to a new one and restart from step 1. Is the idea okay but needs improvement? Change it - and restart from step 1)

what would it take for the company to earn \$100M/yr

the price of the product x customer amount = \$100m/yr
Problem
Solution
Insight
Evaluating ideas
be pessimistic rather than optimistic when evaluating your idea

product
How likely is it that you can build a product that is 10 times better than the exisiting way of doing things?
acquisition
can you find and market to the users of this product?
market
is the market big and growing?
defendability
when the product gets traction will the product have unique features that are hard to copy?

Vivino has a lot of data about wines which is hard to copy

buildability
can you get the team, knowledge and capital to build this product?
you want to aim to build a monopoly, a company that is one of a kind and so far differentiated from the competition that its not even competing

tell everyone around you your idea

draw it out

constantly seek criticism

build stuff you want to use

utlise online communities

Jobs To Be Done Framework

what's the smallest possible test we can do to test the idea?

do something exceptional for your users

is there a problem

is the problem painful enough

is the problem frequent enough (weekly vs once 8 years?)

are there enough people with the same problem (500 ppl vs 20M)

how hard is it to reach to people with problem (channels)

is market saturated by big brands (i.e. spring water)

is solution at least 3x better than current substitute for any segment of market?

does the solution-business model work (subscription, cross-sell, upsell, partnerships, sponsorships, grants, etc)

is there a segment that can be the early adopters?

is there a road to other bigger segments?

Entrepreneurship is NOT about big ideas

There are 5.6m employer firms in the USA, thats at least 5.6m entrepreneurs in the USA. Most of these entrepreneurs have businesses in existing industries. People today have been poisoned by click bait regarding geniuses like Mr. Zuck or Page. & Brin who have dominated their fields and created wealth beyond anyone's wildest dreams yet their ideas weren't original, Google wasn't the first search engine. It wasn't the second, not even the third.

Successful business is all about execution. A great team with a dull and mundane product are so much more likely to get succeess than a college grad with a big dream.

If you feel that being an entrepreneur requires a big idea, you are a wantrepreneur

If you carry a notebook with all yout great ideas, you are a wantrepreneur.

If you have so many great ideas but just lack focus (also known as as the ability to execute well), you are a wantrepreneur

> Stop dreaming, start executing

## Where to start
Doing startups is committing to an indefinite marathon

agenda:

get some ideas on paper
mapping out the problem
figuring out a solution
able to clearly describe what you startup does
What is a startup?
a startup is a temporary organization in search of a scalable, repeatable, profitable business model.

The area of focus
You're probabaly wondering where the hell do I even start? Well, you should start thinking about what subjects you know really well.

get your pen and paper and sketch out the things you're good at. Here's David's interests as an example:

{' '}


### finding the problem
Don't worry about trends in buiness right now or what's popular, it's more important to choose in a space you know a lot about

Now with your interests taken into account, what's a clear problem you've found within one of those subjects?

the club David DJs at has an issue finding talent to play shows each night
local up-and-coming musicians he knows need help getting recognition
launching new music is hard and musicians don't make a lot of income from it
He could find any resources on how to start being an independant musician, so he could learn how to and whilst doing so, write a guide for others in same boat
People visiting Prague don't know the best hidden places to go for a night out (that only the locals like him know about)
Dating is hard for many people, especially with knowing what to say and how to act...
discovering new artists is hard
start with a probem that you know personally, and also something that many other people have

Since it is an itch for you, there's at least person who will want to pay for it. I like ideas that I know I will pay \$5 for on the spot if a solution exists.

The itch is usually a problem that you share with some other subset of people, and often times it's a group that you have free marketing channel access to. It's much easier for me to do customer validation on the hypothetical trail running app than a scuba diving app as a non-swimmer.

I am more often than not the right person to build an app that solves my own problems. Scratching your own itch and an itch of those people who you share a trait with is intrinsically rewarding.

Brainstorm with some friends, see what they think

three meaningful problems around which to build a venture-scale business:

Cost – something is too expensive.
Convenience – something is too hard to do or find.
Moral – something is immoral to a certain group.
Arvid Kahl mentioned the follow criteria for finding critical problems that people will pay for (in his great bootstrap guide Zero To Sold):

If the solution saves them time

If the solution saves them money

If the solution makes them money

### Identify your customers
Problem

Idea

Can I make this?

Are people currently spending money on it?

How will I get the first 25/250 customers?

Will it be sustainable?

Am I the person to build this business?

### Cost Problems
Cost is an eternal problem. People would almost always rather pay less for the same quality, real and perceived (except for luxury goods). Cost tends to be the easiest problem to convey because it’s so obvious, although sometimes that leads to ignorance about why current offerings are so expensive. Founders solving cost problems need to develop novel solutions to reduce their own cost of manufacturing or operation, so they can pass savings on to customers

Dollar Shave Club Problem: Decent razor blades are too expensive. Solution: Deliver “f*cking great” blades to your door every month at a reasonable price.

SpaceX Problem: Space travel is too expensive. Solution: Reuse rocket components to reduce the cost of launches.

Competing on cost alone is rarely an attractive business model unless you do it at great scale like Walmart, which is by definition almost impossible for a small, startup company. Building a brand is important for all startups regardless of what kind of problem they solve but even more so for companies solving a cost problem. Even though a company’s product costs less than incumbents, those companies have to make their customers believe the product is just as good or even better so they can achieve decent margins. Thus, price is rarely the lead benefit for a company solving a cost problem.

Warby Parker doesn’t sell cheaper glasses, they sell really cool glasses that just happen to cost less.

### Convenience Problems
Convenience problems aren’t as tangible as cost problems because there’s no easy number to relate to when describing convenience. Convenience problems tend to result from government regulation or legacy incumbent solutions that are at least passable in modernized markets. Convenience problems are reflected by difficult-to-use, inconvenient, or hard-to-find existing solutions.

Convenience solutions are fundamentally about reducing friction for the customer, which saves them time. Peter Thiel wrote about great companies being 10x better than the alternative. This is the mandate to solve convenience problems.

Google Problem: It’s too hard to find what you’re looking for online. Solution: Superior search technology that just works.

Uber Problem: It’s inconvenient to hail a black car. (Uber later solved a cost problem for broader transport, which is what drove their largest success.) Solution: Hail a car by pressing a button on your phone.

Stripe Problem: It’s too hard for online vendors to set up payments. Solution: Set up online payments in minutes.

The solutions built by all of these companies save users time. Time savings as compared to alternatives is the most valuable measuring stick for convenience solutions.

Moral Problems
Moral problems happen when societal opinions change around previously unchallenged solutions or behaviors, usually driven by some vocal minority that has more qualms about the problem than the user base at large. Companies solving moral solutions should focus on serving these socially-conscious users first.

Tesla Problem: Automobiles are bad for the environment, but there’s no viable alternative to traditional gas vehicles. Solution: The world’s best EV.

JUUL Problem: Cigarettes cause cancer, but I still want to smoke, and there’s no way to inhale nicotine without carcinogens. Solution: A vaporizer that avoids burning tobacco for nicotine consumption.

Beyond Meat Problem: I care about animal welfare and sustainability, but I enjoy meat. Solution: Plant-based products that look and taste like meat.

Moral solutions need to operate within the constraints of established user expectations and behavior. These companies accepted that consumers love the existing experiences around cars, cigarettes, and meat. To create viable replacements, they each had to recreate the same experiences while eliminating the moral problem. Tesla couldn’t just build an electric vehicle, they had to build an electric vehicle as good as any gas car on the market. Beyond Meat couldn’t just make a new soy burger, they had to recreate the look, feel, smell, and taste of meat.

To build a massive business, moral solution companies need to convince mainstream users of existing products to care enough about the moral problem to switch or, more likely, make their products meaningfully better than the existing solution

### Why you?
What makes you perfectly suited to solving this problem? Do you have personal experience with this problem ? what field are you experienced in? play to your strenghs The problem you choose to tackle should have some of these factors:

Personal:

you could talk about this problem for 30 minutes or longer with passion.
it's a problem that you will fight for
you've had past experience with this problem and can feel empathy for others that have had this problem too.
you've experienced this problem yourself/ know a lot about it
Customers:

people have problem daily/weekly and encouter this problem over and over again
many people have this problem
this problem is growing, more and more people are going to encounter this problem
it's a mandatory problem, it's something that must be solved
Stop and think about the internal motivation that you have for picking this particular problem. If it is for status or just because you feel it 'will generate a lot of income' you're going to lose the motivation quite quickly. Also, what's the point in making something you're not excited and passionate about?

A really good way to test your idea is to go to a house party and try to explain it to people you meet, you'll end up refining and changing your pitch slightly each time you explain it to a new person.

How much do you give a shit about the problem?

Ignore thinking about subjects that are popular / doing well/ 'clearly will be successful'. I had an idea about making personal stores for people with NFT collections because I met someone who had to build their own website from scratch and said it was difficult. But I lost all motivaation for it? why? well I just never really 'got the hype' about NFTs at all, I was just hearing about how successul it is right now and saw an oppurtunity. Now I know that that jus wasn't a problem that I was going to be motivated enough to fix.

### Key Considerations
Below are items to consider when deciding whether or not to start a company:

1 Is the invention a disruptive technology? If not, how would it be categorized? 2 How soon can a commercial product come to market? 3 What is the level of risk associated with this startup? 4 Does the technology have clear applications and a definable market? 5 Who owns the intellectual property (IP)? 6 What will be my role in the new company: full–time employee, advisory board member, executive, or consultant? 7 What are the goals for the company? Is it to grow the company and position it for an acquisition or a possible initial public offering (IPO)? Or, is it to build a small, yet sustainable business? 8 Will capital from private investment companies be needed? If so, will the company eventually be sold or go public? Private investors rely on these exit strategies to get a return on their investments.

The valuations are based on several factors, including: • In what stage of development is the technology? • Is there proof-of-concept? • Is there a working prototype? • Are there paying customers?

Talk about your ideas; the more feedback you receive, the higher the likelihood of success.
Talk to potential customers. The information obtained by asking questions will provide critical feedback that not only will increase confidence in the startup’s potential, but also will enhance the likelihood of receiving funding and, ultimately, the success of the venture. • Who are your customers? • What do they care about? • Can the company’s product(s) solve their problems? • How are they currently addressing the problems? • How does the technology solve their problems in a unique way? • How large is the market? • How much are they willing to pay for a solution?
The solution
What solves this problem? Your solution you come up with right now is not going the be the final solution, just start a rough idea of where this could go. Think in a non specific way of what the solution is, for example, here are some problems and potential solutions:

the club can't find talent to play shows each night
a way for venues to find talent locally available and book them with ease
Your idea will change many times so don't stress too much

### but what do investors want?
Investors want to understand your vision of the future and believe in it.

they want to hear from founders that know what their company is doing and what the problem is
they want to understand exactly what it is you're explaining to them
An investor's job is to scout out interesting startups, get on a call with you and hear your pitch, and then pitch your idea themselves to the Partners of the fund. Knowing this, already you know you've got to be memorable, but also concise with your explaination.

### the Founding team
forget about b2b apps if youre 18-25 yrs you have no experience there should be 2-3 founders in total, helps keep the vision going wanna do it alone? you should be an expert in your field

if youre over 30 you should avoid b2c , you've spent 10 yrs in an industry after 30 you can be a single founder no problem

Market
Do some research on your market, see how big it is, what problems are already being solved, what are your competitors doing

your MVP
a MVP is a minimum viable product, its the minimum solution you need to build to fix that issue

What's your vision for the future?

Be in love wih your problem

Be in love with the customer

> Treat your product in a way it can change, don't fall in love with it - Michael Seibel

### Product Market Fit
Presenting to Investors
Presenting the idea along with the supporting research to investors is an important step in the startup process, and one that requires thorough preparation. When scheduling a meeting with an investor, be very clear about its purpose. An informational or exploratory meeting may be acceptable, but be sure that the investor understands that this is the intent of the meeting. If the purpose of the meeting is to request funding, and the presentation team is not properly prepared, then subsequent meetings (and funding) are unlikely. Include the following information in the company pitch: • What problem does the technology address? • How does the technology provide a solution? • What market is being pursued? What is the addressable market? Do not inflate data; if the idea is for a particular market segment, provide data for that segment only.

Market size

Target customer

Market segment • What is the state of the intellectual property? Is the technology well protected? Will IP be needed from other sources? • Who is the competition? Investors expect that there is competition in every market area; claims of no competition are generally met with disbelief. What is the competitive advantage? Why would customers prefer the product or solution being offered over another? • Who is on the executive team, and what are their roles? Why should someone invest in this team? • How does the business model relate to the sales strategy and pricing? • What are the expense and revenue projections for a five-year period? • What are the key company milestones? • How much money is being requested? How long will it last? How will the funds be spent? The presentation should be interesting and engaging. Tell a story and use examples. If potential customers or partners have provided feedback, include examples.

look up who's tried it before, someone definately has


### When going into a new project..
wrk out if you're gonna do it alone

temper your excitement

appeal and marketibility are the most important factors

prototype!

be open for experimentation

don't go into it with a fixed idea of what you want to create
be open to all solutions, be open to experiment
do your research, find out if there's an audience for your game


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Kzu5FdplV0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

find competitiors
use their apps
read the reviews - hat do people like, what do they dislike
know wha makes your startup different

design around your USPs
stand out
finish your MVP quickly!

within 1 month you should have a usable demo up and running
this means you can show it to people, test it
always build things finished

you're adding polished content to your already finished game.
can publish at any time this way
What you should do is slice your game into small independent systems, and implement each system one by one, starting with the most essential ones. For example, start by coding your player movements. Only when that is working without bugs, start the next most essential feature. This takes a bit of self-control when you are motivated to start many cool features, but has many benefits: a game that is always playable, theoretically publishable at any time, in which you know exactly what is done or not, with cleaner separated code, less bugs, and it's easier to cut your scope if you overscoped (which happens approximately 100% of the time).

The best advice I got is from the amazing developers from LANDFALL (They made cluster trucks, TABS, and tons of other amazing games) They told me that after they create a small prototype they post it on social media and Reddit. If the post doesn't get a lot of engagement, they try something different. They use social media to see if the game has this "Appel", which can be tested super early.

make sure to keep working.

Take action. Take responsibility for you life, stop the excuses

My advice is that you don't want to make a game more complicated than you are able to develop.

My advice: Have a production-mindset. Make a development plan and mostly include things that you KNOW you can do and you already know how you'll do it. Update that plan constantly. Track your tasks, know exactly when you want to be finished and how much you'll need to do to get there. Invest the time into those production considerations early so you don't lose tons of time later on. One of the biggest time sinks is not working because you're at the end of a task and don't know what to do next / have another blank page in front of you Also part of the production mindset is to work smart but don't get too obsessed with the "beauty" of your code. The result counts. And getting there as easily and quickly as possible. Be pragmatic here. Don't build your own engine out of programmer pride, only to make a game with it at the end you could have made with established software in way less time and with a higher level of polish. {' '}

Its new app instead uses “real-time” technologies to make recommendations that take into account a user’s preferences as well as other details about their current context — like the weather, season, traffic and the popularity of the place at the current time of day — in order to provide a better-curated set of recommendations. The end result is meant to be a city guide that’s more like “a concierge in your pocket,” says Welcome co-founder Matthew Rosenberg.

epic is a digital reading platform, an online library of sorts, for kids 12 and under. It boasts more than 35,000 books, audio books and videos from 250 publishers including big brand names such as Sesame Street and National Geographic. “Our offerings are three times the size of an average elementary school library,” said Kevin Donahue, an Epic! co-founder. “It’s an environment where kids are really in control,” he said

subscription service for \$7.99 a month for unlimited access,
Epic! gives the service away to teachers and schools. Making it free at school, for schools, definitely increased brand awareness, said Suren Markosian, co-founder and CEO. “Early on we knew that teachers using it, adapting it was important. And they are our most active audiences,
they have 1.7 million paying subscribers since its founding. “Because our mission is to nurture a love of reading and learning, we also knew that by giving it away we’d get more kids better access to more books and learning opportunities,” Markosian said
“We recognized a real problem,” said Donahue. “That kids did not have a place designed for them, for reading. And when we look at the players, it looks like no one is addressing kids and families in a way that’s responsible and putting kids first and we have an opportunity to fill that void in a larger way that consumers are beginning to demand,” he said. “We like to say that the Internet was not built for kids but Epic! was, and that matters.”

“The big story in 2020 was that everyone needed telehealth services for themselves, and we saw that transfer to pets and then exacerbated by the industry,” he added. “The surge in people getting pets caused emergency room waits to grow to up to 10 hours, while it started taking four to six weeks to get a vet appointment.”

Incredible Health Sudanese doctor-turned-entrepreneur Iman Abuzeid, 36, and software engineer Rome Portlock, 41, cofounded this online marketplace for hiring nurses in 2017. Incredible Health flips traditional hiring on its head—letting employers, in this case hospitals, apply to nurses. Its matching algorithms help cut the hiring process from months to weeks. While it’s free for nurses, more than 500 hospitals, including Kaiser Permanente and HCA Healthcare, pay annual subscriptions priced according to their total number of hires.

Squire This all-in-one platform for barbershops started out as a booking site. It soon expanded into financial services and is now testing distribution of supplies such as razor blades.
