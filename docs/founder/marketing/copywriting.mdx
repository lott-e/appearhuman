# Copywriting
Who are your users
Before writing any content for your site, you should know these three things.

who are you trying to appeal to?
create personas
customer journey mapping
Where does the website sit in their journey?
does the customer reach the website after a few emails?
are they ready to buy by the time they hit your website?
What do you want them to do next
Think about the sales funnel, the journey users go on.

Attract attention
a customer finds a creator on youtube that they like
Make a connection with people
the customer googles the creator and finds their website. The creator wants to make a connection (long term) by signing the person up to a mailing list.
Keep engagement
The creator must keep making great content so that hopefully the customer will stay interested
Encourage contact/ purchase
Context is everything. Understanding your users needs is everything. - Paul Boag

Creating your value proposition
A value proposition is a company's promise to deliver specific value or benefits to a customer, and outline how it proposes to fulfil on that promise.

what is the problem you're solving?
how does your offering help solve the problem?
what benefit can I expect to get?
why should I chose you over competitors?
You want to show media that is relatable to your audience, make connections with those people

three sections to every good landing page

1. Strapline
should say what the product is
saas product, app, manual
emphasise one benefit that thing will provide
2. Benefits
Make a bullet point list of benefits to the customer
3. How you deliver
tackle objections
Writing compelling copy
most people suck at writing copy but it' a skill you can learn.

people read less than 25% of the copy on a page

Landing pages are made for two types of people

the scanner

person scans the website reading the headings
relies on gut reaction to sign up or not
the details person

this person is who the 'learn more' button is for. They want to read a lot of inforamtion and find answers to their questions
they will come to a conclusion after anaylsing options
every website is made up of content blocks

deal with objections when they come up, for example at the sign up, explain what will be done with their info

people don't read your copy they scan it

make your copy as scannable as possible
use simple language
remove necessary filler content such as "hey welcome to our site".
anything that doesn't answer questions, remove it
get to the point quickly
sound HUMAN
don't ask people to do too many things
focus on a main cta you want them to take
It's important to understand where the user has to make descisions along your lander. To click the pricing button is a decision
