# How to tell a great story
Storytelling is artifice. Always tell a story but make it artifically wonderful to experience.

There are some things that will engage the audiience emotionally and other things that won't

Stories are how we communicate emotions to others, it's human. Part of life.

A better story means leaving impact on the viewer, communicating the message that you want to and with Youtube it means to get more views.

stories help your audience connect with your content
a good story solves a problem for someone
Don't tell a story if it's not any good
tell a story that gets people to CARE
The goal is to keep the viewer engaged. Keep them watching, listening, intrigued with waht might enfold.

## The art of telling a great story
The distance between you and every single thing that you need and want is your language - Lisa Nichols

> It's in the story that you felt connected to me, you bonded with me. In the content you learn from me.

In any conversation, give content, give a bit of you, and a story. The story is a bridge between the content, the services/whatever you're selling, and the education - The thing the listener is going to take from this.

What does a story need to have in it?
The power is when you show a story. Within 'show me' story you have to take risk. You have to tell the listener what is going on in your head. Tell them what you're feeling, what you're thinking, show the complexity going on in your mind.

Don't tell them you were angry, tell them the WAY it FELT. Show the anger.

We speak in a lazy manner. Everything needs to be unpacked. Unpack your feelings. Show them your thoughts. Put the listener right there in the battlefield with you.

You want your audience to wish for an encore. "Take me with you again. Anywhere"

You must come to every conversation with nothing to hide, protect, prove, or defend. Come in full transparency, emotionally butt naked.

A story will reach out and grab your audience. It will show them themselves in you

You have to leave hooks in what you say that will relate to the audience.

The dip theory. How I became who I am today.

dark point
struggle
what I had to overcome
lessons learnt
life mission now
who i am today
People need to hear the struggle, the dip, to know you are like them.

## Three act Structure Any good story people care about is about **character transformation**
a character who wants something.

they overcome conflict to get that thing

the character is transformed by the process

Set the scene
This is the initial brief for the viewer.

Here's what's going to happen
Here's an issue that we might/will face
Here's the goal that we are hoping to achieve
Give the viewer context so that they can be present with you in that moment. This looks like a quick summary of the events to come in youtube and reality tv. It's buying the attention of your viewer so that they will stay to see how this story pans out.

Tell the viewer the goal of your video and the challenge that is to come. Youtube is fast paced.

give quick, clear context so that the viewer is ready to go on this journey
tell the history of whats going on if necessary.
viually show the location, start building out the world/location where your character is.
frame the problem. Most people when pitching jump straight into what their product does. This is wrong. If there isn't a problem we don't need a solution. Relate the problem to the listener so they are on the right page with you.

The set up
Talk about your expectations of what will happen in dramatic ways. Tell the audience your hopes and fears at this particular event

That thing speaks to me because I grew up skateboarding...

Who is the character?
You cannot assume people will work this out themselves, it must be made very clear.

What do they want?
What is the goal? This must be clear and understood

Story Delay. Why can't they get what they want?
Roadblocks, complications, challenges.

Drag out the conclusion of the story as much as you can.

Ask Dramatic questions.

will the character live?
will the character forgive?
if you tell the audience who the killer is in the opening, why would they watch the murder mystery

What's at stake?
Stories are about conflict. there's the normal, the explosion. then the new normal

as humans we want to learn the lessons without having to suffer ourselves.

we live vicariously through them

Exaggerate things
If he misses the bus, his life in that moment is over.

Think about when a kid has a bad haircut, they feel like their life is going to end. That everybody will hate them.

Who or what comes along to help the character?
How do they ultimately get what they want?
How is the character transformed
The character being different at the end is hugely impactful. The audience want to know what happens to the character they invested their time into. There is a need for a conclusion to all the prior events

consequence
People are moved by the stories of PEOPLE. Not numbers or facts.

Personal stories
A story told from your point of view must take the listener on the same emotional journey that you faced. There is a temptation to jump ahead and get to the end of the story early, telling people what you learned. Do not do that. Take the listener on the same winding journey you went on.

To keep attention, add mystery constantly
Every story needs a near constant element of mystery to keep the listener engaged. Every time you answer one mystery, another must come up.

The best stories have lessons at the end.
Aesops fables.

Know the purpose - what the audience needs to take away from this. Tell people WHY you just took them on that journey.

If there is an action you wish they would take, then make it clear.


3 Principles To Master Storytelling
How to 10X Your YouTube VIEWS with Storytelling
How To Vlog and Be a Better Storyteller
emotion is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

Ensure each cut is motivated
The cuts that happens directly before your 'highlight moment' need to inform the cut that comes after it

have a clear and consistent motivation to what happens next
always ensure a sequence is motivated with context and reason
ensure your shots have a justifiable reason to be present
TIP
a motivated shot is one that has been set up in some way beforehand. There has been a reason established for the shot to exist, you as a viewer are motivated to see that shot

Leading into the next scene with the audio allows audience know what's going to happen next.

WARNING
a web content's number 1 rule is to have a clear and consistent motivation to what happens next.

Steal ideas. since your voice and personality is unique, it'll make it your own
see something you like? copy it.
most good ideas are 2-3 previous ideas stitched together
every new piece of media exists because it's been influenced by something they've seen before
watch content. Look for stuff to steal and stitch together
look for stories, techniques and effects
Control your doubt
In time you will be a good creator.
Reframe 'I dont know how" to "I want to know how"
The HOOK
This is the first 7-10 seconds which is where the audience decides to watch your video or not.

reels you in, it catches your attention, it's captivating.
this is added LAST after editing everything else down
retention is one of the most important statistics for your video
set up an average rhythm with your cuts, for example 1 to 2 to 1 to 2 to 4 second clips. This creates anticipation. Once you experience that 4 second clip, you really focus on it

The Prelude/ SETUP.
The intro of your video is all about setting up the WHY. Why do they even need to do this thing? You cannot expect the viewer to stay til the end, you have to win them over and get them to stay. You need to reassure the viewer that they've made the right descision to watch your video.

includes a promise of what you're going to see
generates curiousity
icebreaker for new viewers
use an out-of-context, interesting clip tha gives you so many questions

Balance progress with setbacks to tell an effective story. talk about the pessimistic view , showcase the struglle of achieving this
teach things, tibits of information
make the audience CARE
For you and your story
spectacle without a WHY or a REASON TO CARE is hollow

know your want
know your need
know your flaw
what story or journey could that create?

I doing X Dangerous Big Thing
what do I want?
what happens if I don't get what I want?
what will I do to get what I want?
by answering these questions, we can make our audience care

Now that I have your attention, let me take you on an adventure (BUILD)
a. change way video is presented, different location does this b. change up the music

(PAYOFF)
The very end should have some sor of a bonus. Maybe it's a behind the scenes, a blooper, an extra joke. Something at the end rewards the viewer and reminds them to watch the whole video next time too.

change the music again
tone change
reward people for making it this far
Watch the before and afters we are shown in this breakdown, the original footage is boring as FUCK!

think. is this clip interesting? Is it a highlight of that experience?
sound is incredibly important. Sound effect help make things more real.
relatability is necessary
cut the music to match the dialogue
