# Conversation



### Framing 

#### Who are they?

#### What do they want from me?

#### What context are we in?

#### How does this benefit me?



### Considerations 


#### Dont' Interupt people

You may think you're adding something. You're most likely not. Your conversation partener will feel you're making this all about yourself or you're just not listening.

#### Pause for a good moment before answering anything

- gives you time to think more on your reply
- makes you appear more careful with your words, therefore adding more weight to what you say
- don't rush, better to say nothing than something silly

#### Speak slowly and clearly

This helps people follow what it is that you're saying 

> SAY LESS + THINK MORE 


#### Refrain from jumping to your own conclusions

Don't let yourself jump around, make sure you fully understand their viewpoint 

#### Let nothing trigger you

Letting our emotions get into this is a bad idea.

- if you do get triggered, get out of there, don't let them bring you into a state of saying things you'd prefer not to.
- don't say emotionally charged things unless you are truly passionate
- don't argue a point 'just because'. 

## What to say

### Does what I'm going to say bring value?
Or am I just being selfish?

### Clarifying questions > Statements 

Choose to keep the conversation going, this isn't about proving a point, who's right or wrong. Conversation is about **sharing ideas** and **genuninely wanting to hear their perspective**.

> If it doesn't end with a question, don't say it


## When to state our own views

### When are statements are okay?

- if directly asked a question "what is your opinion on ___" ?

even then, give your answer, ask something back in return. Maybe where they stand on the same piece?

### If it starts with 'I', refrase 

- "In my view"


### Beware 

- people like to hide how they really feel about our views
- sometimes opening up fully is not a good idea
- most people view oversharing as anxious or strange behaviour

### Topics to converse about
I think you might find it cringy for the same reason I do, it basically feels like everyone's playing a role in a drama show

## Literal thinking
You're "missing the point" of what everyone is saying.

Almost nothing is literal. Everything is actually like a tiny poem, or a song. Every "How are you?" contains clues depending on context, depending on how it's said. Pauses. Inflection. But every normal sentence has a bunch of invisible information attached to it that in order to get by socially you need to infer, and you need to quickly analyze it, and see what people are getting at.

If someone says something and you go "oh, this makes me think of this. So I'll go on about this related topic. Or I'll pick some subject this person is talking about and I'll talk about something about that." And often times, but not necessarily, this misses the mark. Like someone might say "I babysitted my friend's bulldog over winter break. We had a great time. He's such a well behaved dog."

What's the next thing to say?

```md

"I like dogs.";

"Oh I also have a bulldog just like your friend!";

"I watch my friend's pets too.";

"Oh, over winter break you know what I did? I went to Hawaii.";

"Did you go on any trips together? Like to the dog park?";

"What does your friend's dog like to eat?";

"That's good your friend's dog was so well behaved. I know how difficult it is to deal with a dog with behavioral issues.";

"That's nice.";
```


Etc. etc. Where is this conversation going? When really, maybe the person said this thing about the dog for some reason other than "oh let's talk about dogs. Or "oh, let's talk about what we did on winter break." The message could maybe be a statement about...hi, I'm demonstrating to you that I am a friendly person. We have this type of relationship with each other where we can talk about these kinds of details about our lives. Nothing too heavy. But...don't be afraid to approach me! I am a chill person.

Something like that.

So many times, I have to run over previous conversations and I realize...oh, this person said THIS because they perceived THIS and they wanted to say something because they thought that I thought this or that. And they were trying to gauge what I was thinking.

Just as an example, one thing I've gotten before was "Hey, cool shoes. Are those doc martens?" said by a coworker. But what I had been doing, is zoning out and staring at my own shoes, checking out how they looked in public. And it looked strange, like something a child would do. So this person says this to me...and my immediate reaction is just "fuckkk I'm doing it again. I look like a dork." But the person said this because they thought that if I heard that, I wouldn't know that THEY thought that I looked weird. They thought I would just think "Oh fuck yeah, my shoes are cool. But maybe I need to be more self aware when I stare at them because it is clear to me now that other people notice when I'm doing it." Rather than the reality of "Goddammit why did I ever think it was a good idea to leave the house."

Aspie guide on talking to people Hello everyone, Matt here Recently I have been improving my social & talking skills, and so I thought- I might do a little tutorial on how to talk.

Firstly- some of the advice may be things that you already know, I'm sharing things that I wish someone told me few years ago, and not "just act normal" or "be yourself".

Secondly- don't let others fool you. You can learn to talk from books or observation. Obviously, practice makes perfect, but at least for me, the written text is way easier to understand, so when actually talking may improve your skills, reading about it may as well. So I'll give you a few tips what to look for.

watch stand-ups. Even if you don't laugh at them, just pay attention to what stand-uppers do, how they talk, how they move. Also people giving public speeches, for more formal talking. You can even make notes if it helps you.

Read college documents/ course books on marketing and negotiating. This may sound a little particular, but trust me, it helped me a lot. Negotiation techniques are often used in normal conversations without people noticing.

Read books on rhetoric- obviously.

Use google. Just type things you are interested in learning and read.

Now to the actual easy to follow guide.

look people in the eyes when you are saying something important, or you try to convince someone to something. Don't look at them longer than for five seconds without a break, it's awkward.

move your hands when describing something, show things with your hands, when for example counting, showing how big something is, or showing next steps you took when doing something.

change your position while standing or sitting, but don't do it too often. Maybe once every two minutes. For example If you are sitting with crossed legs, swap them. The important thing is that it has to be subtle. Unless you have a bouncy leg, then you're good. Just don't be too stiff.

whenever you have to forcefully smile, dull it down for about 50%, No exceptions. Don't show teeth unless told too. Same goes for laughing. People like when you smile at them. Unless they are angry at you.

change tone of your voice OFTEN. It's really important so that people will pay attention to you longer. Do it subtle. Don't go super quiet and suddenly super loud. Change it a little, like when you are excited. (It's really well shown in stand-up.)

make a list of things you wanna talk about, before important talks, or like phone calls.

don't go over the top with your vocabulary. I like fancy words too, but people will think you are showing off. Use simple language.

look at feet. It may sound weird, but you can easily tell, when someone you are talking to wants to leave- basically if their feet is not facing you. (Exceptions: when the person you are talking to is on your right or left, when you are in a group more than two people, when you are in a crowded area)

When you talk about something, and the other person is quickly changing the subject, it usually means they DON'T wanna talk about it anymore. Don't go back to this subject, even when it was super interesting to you.

Listen to what the other person is saying and ask them questions about it, it makes people feel heard and everyone likes to have some attention paid to them. Don't get lost in your thoughts, unless you want to come out as impolite.

Learn how to read emotions. It may be really hard at first, but there are a lot of articles on the internet that really well explain how people look when they feel in a certain way. If you are not sure, what the person is feeling and it's not a good idea to ask them in the moment, imagine how would you feel if something simmilar they went through would happen to you.

Remember that even if something isn't interesting to you, it may be interesting to others. Just think about the thing they are talking about, as their special interest. You like talking about it, and so do they.

Make others happy without a reason. You like being happy and so do others, so pay attention to others, and they will give attention to you!

> Don't talk over people. Never.

When someone is talking to you, say “right, right, right” occasionally. People like that apparently. And repeat sometimes words people say, like their point or phrase they emphasized.>

••Quanitity** is a conversational maxim

> a normal conversation will flow well when people provide an adequate amount of information, not too much, not too little

most people want to have fun, funny conversations. Be the first to initiate playfulness

## Not being boring

### Joking about
People need permission to laugh at you joke, if it isn't clear whther it's a joke or not people are very rarely going to take the risk of laughing where they weren't supposed to.

set a playful tone
if you're being Non-literal, you need to exaggerate it, be a little absurb, make it clear you're joking

### Assuming interest
ever been talking to someone and they launch into a boring monologue you didn't care about?

create interest BEFORe launching into your story
use a storygap: build interest in the story by hinting at how it ends *without spoiling the punchline - hint at something the other person now ants to hear more about Example
> "I ran into Ben a few times, Ben might still be mad at me.. true story"

the listener knows the ending -you pissed Ben off - but now they'll want to know how it happens

### Conversation stalls after you're asked a question?
Yeah this is because you're giving bland 1-5 word answers.

> "Where are you from?" "Wales, Cardiff" "What do you do?" websites and stuff

or worse you're saing "mhm" Fact is, you're giving them nothing to ask you more about, nowhere for the conversation to go


>  your short answers put all the pressure on the other person to carry the
  conversation, you want to make it EASY for people to carry on the conversation

share enough to make conversation easy for the other person
create space for them to speak as well

## Asking questions
Don't fall into default questions like "how are u", "so you're from round here?" no.

ask people stuff they'd be excited to answer
ask about their passions
ask them about what they're proud of
Don't know them yet?

ask fun hypotheticals
"

## Are you even listening?
Talking to someone who's being too passive while listening can be boring or even uncomfortable. Be a likeable listener

Repeat their gestures Mirror them by repeating the pattern of behaviour of the person you're talking to

copy the way they're seated
mirror their gestures
repeat the last few words they said

### Make THEM feel smart and funny
people like to see that they were able to make you laugh

"REward people" for saying a funny joke, show them it has an effect on you by laughing

do not fake laugh (i know most people aren't funny but try ok? Humor can be childisand silly, enjoy it)
don't censor your laughter, don't be afraid to chuckle
••people want confirmation you heard them•• People need to hear confirmation that you understood what they said, just saying "yeah" is not confirmation.

Repeat what they said back to then in a slightly differed way to show your understanding

### Find it hard to get a word into conversations?
Don't leap into conversations only to be cut off - people will subconciously believe that your opionions aren't worth of being heard

when you begin your sentence, contine talking to the end of that sentence. Only then should you allow someone to interrupt you You encourae others to respect you more and they will be far more likely to listen when you're able to speak again

### Treating people as inidviduals
The best way to ddo this is referring to people by their name

has a very positive effect on the reciever

take the time to look at each person while you speak, give each person about 3seconds. It makes them feel included

### Emphasise similarities you have with others
You need to show people that you're like them too, so they don't catch that you're an alien, of course. So bringing up similarities is a good idea

### Give genuine compliments
Someone's unkind to you?
If someones a jerk to your face it's pretty hard not just yell some worse insults back at them.

Be calm, keep eye contact, and give a prolonged silence
scripted

go to phrases

> learn to pause to think about what he's gonna say before he says it. It's sometimes frustrating because it affects the flow of conversation but better to take that extra few seconds than mess up and not be able to take it back.

Also it's good to have a short list of off limit topics for everyday conversations. This helped me quite a bit as a teenager. It's also good for black and white thinking because I will without fail avoid certain statements this way. An example is not commenting on people's appearance whatsoever. Or not talking about firearms, sexually explicit jokes, etc. I would tell him to only try out risqué jokes with close friends who know him well I have a dark sense of humor as most of us do and while some of my friends think I'm hilarious, employers, coworkers, colleagues, classmates most likely will not share his sense of humor.

## Socialising
> If she/he doesn't really care about social interaction, why force it?

I don't mind being alone at all, if you feel the same, that is totally okay! I want you to be at the stage where you know you could attain friends if you wanted them, but you've decided to spend your time alone.

### Ok so how do I make friends?

### Conversation
It may be known to you that the art of conversation is carried out within a set of constraining rules.
When people take part in a conversation, what they say normally has to follow on from the last thing that was said. We stick to the relevant so that the conversation flows smoothly.
Be careful of stating the obvious. You may also wish to avoid asking questions when you can work out the answer for yourself. This way the conversation covers more useful ground.
Try to avoid repeating yourself or rephrasing yourself when you have already been understood. This may be rather difficult because repetition of thought is quite fundamental to autism. The same thoughts can go round and round ‘obsessively’ in your head. If you have to go on talking about it, try to think up new angles or different ways of putting it; better still, look for a way of leading into a different subject. I take the approach of always looking for new things to think about. This seems to have been quite a successful move.
There may be subjects that fascinate you and you really want to talk about them. If your listeners’ eyes look unfocused, or they keep looking over your shoulder, they may be getting bored. You can say ‘Sorry I’ve been going on, it’s a favourite subject of mine’.
Also some people reply to things you say before even giving you a chance to finish your sentence. However, if they have anticipated you correctly then there is usually no need for you to finish.
If you say something that doesn’t make sense to the people around you they might get annoyed but will probably forgive you. After all, everyone does this sometimes. Just don’t do this too often.
If there is something you need to say which is not relevant but is important, for example ‘Bob phoned for you today’ or ‘there’s something I’d like to talk to you about which is worrying me’ it is best to find the suitable person when they’re not having a conversation. Try to find the right moment, get your timing right. If you need to pass on a phone call and think that you might forget if you are kept waiting too long, just write it down and leave it by the phone.
If what you need to tell them is vitally important for example ‘Bob has just had a nasty knock on the head and is lying unconscious’, then you MUST interrupt their conversation.
To join in a conversation you need to listen to it. Listening can be extremely difficult, especially if you have to keep your ears open 24 hours a day, but you can get better with practice. The most important thing to listen to is the plot of the conversation.
Be on the lookout for eye contact from other people as it can often mean they would like to hear your point of view.
It is easier to listen if you don’t make any assumptions or pre-conceived ideas about what someone is going to say.
Some topics of conversation are taboo subjects and if you are in doubt they are sometimes better left alone.
When a conversation becomes emotional people often say things like ‘cheer up’, ‘it’ll be all right’, ‘oh that’s wonderful!’ or ‘well done!’. When you try to say these things they might sound rather corny and sentimental at first but they serve the same purpose as remembering to buy someone a birthday card. They serve to open up the conversation and invite the other person to express how they feel.

### Starting conversations
Your first few seconds are really vital to showing you're worth interacting with

seriously just look at the person, whats the first thing you noticed? was it their tattoo? their boots? That's it you've found your opener.

keep conversation surface level - do not go deeper, deep conversation is reserved for when THEY allow for it

### Openers

```md
Nice to meet you, what’s your name?

Hey! I love your honest something you like that they're wearing , end with a question

Hey! I love your boots / hair / tattoo / necklace / style

aww thankyou!

something related to that thing (for example if tattoo you could talk about how interesting the style is / what does it mean to them / why they got it)

```

### Names
Do not forget their name. When you get a chance you can write their name down in your phone notepad. If you forgot their name,

For example I go to this coffee shop pretty often so I had a note:

```md
Coffee Haus

Dominica
Philip
Peter
Jake
For people I want to know long term I'd have notes too

Denise

studying marketing
wants to be a journalist
is from Russia
has a pet rabbit
likes old movies
bypassing logical gates
```

don't get offended by what im gonna say
language doesnt require permission listen for red flags, ban that person

There are many reasion these rules exist

conversation must have a goal (if you want life to go your way)

when you go to a coffee shop youre conversing to get a coffee

having interactions - how quickly can i get this inforamtion out of this person

mentally prod

keep track of where this conversation is going

don't worry about offending people stand by your beliefs (however always be open to being challeneged on beliefs)



### Tone of voice
You might be one of these people who almost talks in a single tone without knowing it.
Ask a trustworthy person if this is true and if it is you may have to exaggerate the intonation in your voice to emphasise what you say, but not too much. This will sound artificial at first.
If you are reading a story-book to a child then the more intonation the better.
The intonation in our voices is extremely important in determining whether we are being enthusiastic or sarcastic about something. It is also important in telling whether we mean something seriously or just as a joke.
To talk in a single tone can make it sound as if you’re depressed. When talking about something good or exciting you have to make yourself sound excited too, otherwise people tend to think it sounds strange.
If you are a young man whose voice is breaking, then if you find it more comfortable just let it break for good. It may sound strange at first on the inside but it will be sounding much more natural on the outside. If you are worried about what your friends might think which should only be a short term problem anyway, it may be useful to take the opportunity of letting your voice break while you are changing schools.
Finally, remember not to speak too loudly and not to speak too quietly. This should depend on the distance between you and the other person and the voice should be quieter when a bit of secrecy is needed. Whisper when everyone else is whispering (or when there is someone asleep nearby).
At times when you may need to talk extra loudly and clearly (e.g. on stage or in a play) then you may want to project your voice. To do this keep a nice straight relaxed posture and imagine that your voice is coming from your stomach, however strange this may seem
Delivery in converstation is EXTREMELY important.
Look at comedians. The way they tell the joke is going on a story with them of ups and downs. They get really animated and excited and loud for some parts and quiet for others?

NTs will understand what other NTs are trying to convey through they body language alone.

Why do your stories suck and have people looking away?

You're NOT TELLING THEM to BE ENGAGEd. sorry for shouting but its true

Why aren't they laughing at my jokes?

It's because you did not tell them to laugh, you did not show them where the funny part was

laugh tracks in tv shows suddenly make a lot more sense eh?

NTs don't want to laugh at the wrong point, you gotta show them its ok to laugh here

Don’t talk about your problems in public or to people who you don’t know (except counsellors). If you do you will be broadcasting your weaknesses to the people around you. Don’t think they won’t be listening.

Talking about your problems in public may get sympathy in the short term but will probably isolate you in the long term.

You may talk about your problems with teachers, parents, close relatives and sometimes with friends if you can get them on their own.
Sometimes but not always it is alright to talk about your problems with friends in a small group but it should be relevant to the conversation
When you do talk about your problems, try to do it without putting yourself down too much. Negative talk causes you negative feelings and negative feelings make you less able to defend yourself. You don’t want to get bogged down into a vicious cycle.

With reference to this last statement, try to get into a positive cycle if you can. This is called PMA (positive mental attitude) whereby thinking about your positive assets makes you feel more positive about yourself and better able to defend yourself from put-downs.
