# Truth

> Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth. ― Marcus Aurelius , Meditations

I automatically assume that most of the time everything that is said by other people is the truth.
Truth doesnt matter, only the interpretation of it

We must learn to listen
If you're young, you may have a similar mentality that I did, that once I'd heard something and formed an opion that felt correct then I was completely correct. Wrong. We need to learn to listen to those with more experience than us. Only speak in detil on a subject when we actually know a substantial amount of knowledge on it

being overly opinionated doesn't help you achieve your goals. You need to learn
to learn, we must look to those who know more than we do
The need to be right
It so so detrimental to you to argue about 'right' and 'wrong' when you're just another human. You haven't achieved anything for yourself yet, you have no credibility.

W've all been told we have a voice and should be heard, youtubers show us that our opinions are all somehow valid. They're not!

remind yourself when you feel the need to argue coming on - how do I know I'm right? Is there a chance they're right?

The brain isn't always on your side
Any one of us with a human brain is capable of delusions,

Distortions of Truth
Sarcasm is when someone says one things but means the opposite. For example - in response to hearing someone burp, someone else might say ‘how polite’. The easiest way of picking up on sarcasm is by listening to the tone of voice. You may need to defend yourself against sarcasm at times and this will be covered in the following chapters.

If someone asks you a question and giving them the true answer might upset them or cause embarrassment or unfair trouble to other people you may decide to tell a ‘white lie’ which is intended to avoid unpleasantness all round.

If someone tries to get a message across to you without hurting you, they might decide to drop a hint. The best example of this is when a man is chatting up a woman but she doesn’t want to go out with him in which case instead of saying ‘I’m not interested, go away’ she might slip the words ‘my boyfriend’ into the conversation.

Sometimes it is possible to be misled by figures of speech (i.e. metaphors). For example ‘I’m over the moon’ means I’m very happy.

Sometimes someone might lie to you if they want something from you. The best example of this is a door-to-door salesman who wants your money. If he sells you a television that doesn’t work then he would be conning you.

In conversation it is not unusual for people to exaggerate. Someone who says ‘I had about ten pints last night’ might actually mean they only had five. People who exaggerate too much can easily be misinterpreted.

If someone says something which sounds offensive in the literal sense ‘You ugly mug face’ but with a laugh and a smile, then they mean it as a joke. You often need to pick up on this quite quickly.

Perhaps the most awkward kind of lies you encounter are teasing lies in which someone says something as a joke to see whether or not you believe them. If what they have just said is highly unlikely or people around them are trying not to laugh, they are probably teasing you. The correct response to this would be to laughingly tell them to p*ss off. If you show doubt as to whether or not they are teasing you, they may see it as a sign of vulnerability. Remember they are probably never going to admit that they are teasing you, no matter how seriously you ask.

People might start trying to persuade you to make a spectacle of yourself somehow. For example they may ask you to do a dance or sing a song. Even if you can’t see anything wrong with this yourself, it is important not to give in to them, no matter how persuasive they become. The correct response is the same as that for a teasing lie, only perhaps with a touch of anger. If you give in to such requests, you will probably become an all-round target for other people’s teasing. If you have already done this in the past, don’t worry, just don’t let it continue.

If you need to find out whether or not someone is lying and you have a good reason for doing so, asking them questions might reveal faults in their logic.
Honesty
Related to that, I also have an extremely hard time to distinguish between someone saying the genuine truth and not telling the full truth in order to create a specific impression, hide something uncomfortable, uphold a certain picture of himself or something, etc. What other people might brush away as unimportant and an unimportant lie can really bother me, even if it's (like most of the time) not at all meant to be harmful or even meant in a positive way from the viewpoint of that person.

Basically all the time. I am like you, & I always assume others are being honest, but I’ve come to the conclusion that virtually all NTs are liars. Some are much worse than others, but from my perspective, they’re all liars. I’m 40 btw, & only realised I was an Aspie 3yrs ago.

many people put appearances and feelings above the truth and they expect everyone else to put the same priority on appearances and feelings. Most of the time if you are talking to an NT, they aren't being fully truthful unless the full truth is convenient to them. Unfortunately I cannot tell if someone is lying or not most of the time and just have to make assumptions on it, that are not always correct.
 
 #Censoring oneself

Assume that everyone lies and you’ll be pleasantly surprised, when you have proof that it was not a lie.

I can lie pretty fine because I’ve been taught that saying how I honestly feel is rude or inappropriate. I consider censoring yourself in front of your work bosses, colleagues etc lying because you are not being your authentic self and you are not saying how you really feel (‘this job is shit’ ‘no, I am not happy with the current pay’ ‘yes, I’m fine thanks and not dreading every minute speaking to you, how are you?’) it is SO REFRESHING to be around people you are allowed to be uncensored with aka ‘rude’ with.

On a given day, studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times - many of thosse are white lies
In another study, strangers lied 3 times within the first 10 minutes of meeting eachother
Extroverts lie more than Introverts
men lie 8x more about themsleves than other people, women lie to protect other people
lying has evolutionary valut to us as a species
the more intelligent the species (the larger the neo-cortex) the more likely it is to be deceptive
Everyone is lying and it's time you started accepting that. You cannot go into every interaction assuming other sare being truthful aka giving everyone the benefit of the doubt.

No mortal can keep a secret, if his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips - Freud

Body Language of lying
Look for the signs of a liar

- frozen upper body
- they look in the eyes a little too much
- fake smiling
- you can tell a real smile from the eyes creasing
