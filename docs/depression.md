Infact, don't game at all

Delete your social media (hard for first two days but fine long term) replace social media with Duolingo

Learn things. even in your down time, learn things about stuff you like. I like ancient history, Berserk Manga, whatever it is

### The voice in your head
I still hear from mine from time to

... from there....

My story can be quite triggering for people as I will just talk about topics with no issue so bear that in mind

## Lessons
Self destruction just keeps getting worse

I went from person wanting to die to person with big reasons to want to die within the space of a few months
from an abusive relationship i then became a stripper, then escort, then pstar, then had absolutely 0 reason to continue...or so I thought
Maybe you ARE the problem

If there is a pattern that keeps happening in your life, that is a clear indication theres something wrong
when i became a stripper, it felt like 'liberation' at the time, yet I was so easy to manipulate even though I 'felt under control'
I was really greedy and lazy, I wanted more money for even less work
Toxic people need to be cut from your life

this includes parents
Maybe you're the toxic one (it's because you hate yourself)

I was nasty, hard to live with, hard to like.
I'd talk shit about people
It’s you bringing yourself down.

Looking back now, I realise I didn’t feel deserving of a good life.
I never worked out, barely washed my bedsheets, never cleaned my room. Now I do all those things
Your brain is really really wrong!! (sometimes)

Looking back, all the bad things that happened to me I did to myself
I got into an abusive relationship, yes, but did I leave? no, not for a long time
I was in hospital for paracetamol ODs twice.. did someone have a gun to my head and force me to take them? no!!
Fill your brain with new things and you'll forget your past

I used to run through all my trauma before sleeping like it was some fucked up movie about my life, I don't do that anymore
I started learning new concepts and now I'd struggle to tell you my worst memories
Treat yourself like you love yourself

There was one point I was living above an abandoned old shop with an old man, with no door, no washed sheets, a shower that didnt work, eating pot noodle.... yet I was working in a strip club earning a lot some nights.... what did I spend the money on? shoes and a motorcycle I couldn't ride. idiot
I noticed when putting clothing away I'd neatly fold all Alex's clothing and just throw stuff into my drawer. I had to start actively removing the clothes from my drawer and making sure I folded them too.
Find something you don't want to lose

No matter what. You can start all over again

Who gives a fuck what people think of you, your past.... That doesn't have to be you anymre
You can be a completely new person if you really try

## Curing it
Find the root of your issues, is it a childhood trauma? - I went to the doctor for more anti-depressants and he said to me 'after looking at your files....I wanted to ask..have you ever looked into your childhood being the origin?"

Instead of continuing to speculate and theorise about my past, I rang my dad and questioned him directly. I hoped for him to call me stupid/ silly for saying accusations yet unfortunately he just started breathing in a panicked way. I'd got as close to the truth that I ever will.
I re watched interviews of myself and saw that I was trying to make a situation of abuse from my cousin into some different story as if I actually wanted it to happen, I'd tell it like a funny story
I was told in school that I was overly sexual but I had no understanding that the way I acted was wrong
Actively make change happen

keep a diary and keep only tips for happiness
Do not live in the past

Do not write songs, poems, definately not a book You are revelling in your past and letting it win!

how to be miserable

Import thing

Nobody cares about your situation but you
You’re right to think your depression is an annoyance for others, people do not care. People are self centred .
And so are you! You care a little too much about what others think
It’s all in your head / sometimes your mind is completely and utterly wrong
Getting out takes you and you alone
Some children with Asperger’s syndrome can become clinically depressed as a reaction to their realization of having considerable difficulties with social integration. The depressive reaction can be internalized, leading to self-criticism and even thoughts of suicide; or externalized, resulting in criticism of others and an expression of frustration or anger, especially when the child has difficulty understanding a social situation. Blame is directed at oneself: ‘I am stupid’; or others: ‘It’s your fault.’ The signs of a clinical depression or problems with anger management could be the first indicators of a developmental disorder such as Asperger’s syndrome.

Problems with social inclusion, acceptance and academic success can precipitate a clinical depression, or anger directed to others or the ‘system’.

The child with Asperger’s syndrome is often immature in the art of negotiation and compromise and may not know when to back down and apologize. He or she will not accept a particular school rule if it appears to be illogical, and will pursue a point or argument as a matter of principle. This can lead to a history of significant conflict with teachers and school authorities.

A reactive depression Social ability and friendship skills are highly valued by peers and adults and not being successful in these areas can lead some children with Asperger’s syndrome to internalize their thoughts and feelings by being overly apologetic, self-critical and increasingly socially withdrawn. The child, sometimes as young as seven years old, may develop a clinical depression as a result of insight into being different and perceiving him- or herself as socially defective. Intellectually, the child has the ability to recognize his or her social isolation, but lacks social skills in comparison to intellectual and age peers, and does not know intuitively what to do to achieve social success. Brave attempts by the child to improve social WHAT IS ASPERGER’S SYNDROME? / 23 integration with other children may be ridiculed and the child deliberately shunned.

There can be changes in sleep patterns and appetite, and a negative attitude that pervades all aspects of life and, in extreme cases, talk of suicide, or impulsive or planned suicide attempts.

There can also be moments of anger at the delay in being diagnosed and at ‘The System’ for not recognizing the signs for so many years. There can be feelings of despair regarding how their lives would have been much easier if the diagnosis had been confirmed decades ago. Other emotional reactions can be a sense of grief for all the suffering in trying to be as socially successful as others, and the years of feeling misunderstood, inadequate and rejected.
