# Eye Contact
Humans want to look at eachothers pupils because they read a lot of information about them

What eye contact means
it's acknowledgment of the other person
you're actively listeining to them speak (humans have no other indication to look to so you must show them that you are listening by looking into their eyes)
When to give eye contact
Eye contact is of course contextual. We give eye contact when:

when you're approaching someone to talk to them
when we are talking to somebody
somebody is talking directly to us
When not to give eye contact
While people are not talking and when you are not talking to them, it is often best not to look at them.
if you're not trying to communicate something to someone there's no need to look at someone
for example, in a restaurant, to get the waiter to come over with the bill you shouldn't wave, and you definately shouldn't shout to him. Instead, make eye contact with him. Contextually the waiter knows the only reason you (a customer) would be looking at them is because you need them to come over

Too little / No eye contact means
you're guilty of something, not to be trusted, have something to hide
you are shy (if you keep looking down)
or you are dishonest (if you keep looking to the side).
Too much eye contact
When humans don't blink enough, they're fixated on something. This is a bit of an attack signal. Or it means they really really like that person

Either you are challenging them (the aggressive gaze)
or you fancy them (the intimate gaze).
What to do with your eyes while someone is speaking to you
blinks must be every now and again

look away for a brief moment and come back to their eyes again

To look at someone for more than two thirds of the time may be communicating that either you like them (if you are looking at the face as a whole) or you are aggressive (if you are looking straight into their eyes)

Seeing a human you know in passing
You're walking out and about in a communal area and there is a person you recognise, there's no need to stop and talk,

exchange glances, smile slightly and raise eyebrows to each other
What is eye contact?

Soft gaze at the entire face – watch the eyes, brows, cheeks, nose, mouth Don’t stare directly into the eyes Don’t focus on one part of the face Practice a conversation from a distance at first with a friend or someone you’re comfortable with Simple rules for beginners:

Always make eye contact when greeting someone or asking a question. Never interrupt someone without first making eye contact. Don’t smile, laugh or joke without watching the face. People think that’s really weird. Maintain eye contact through the entire transaction: both the question and the answer. You can look away briefly to consider your response, then return to the face. If you violate these rules, people will mislead you and insult you to your face and you won’t notice because you’re not looking at them. But your social anxiety will escalate.

Advanced rules:

Keep track of things people say to you that stump you. Then you can consider responses when it happens again – because it will. Twitter Email
