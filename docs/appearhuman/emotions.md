# Emotions

## How to control your emotions
> You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

To control your emotions means to have the power to choose how to feel in most situations . If you learn this, you'll be able to avoid doing things you regret in anger, sadness...Whatever happens to you things won't get out of control.

We can end up doing crazy things if we let our emotions control us, things we regret. Perhaps you feel you are an 'emotional person' and simply couldn't control it, perhaps sometimes you have arguements where you say things you didn't mean to.

All of this can break relationships and lead to a difficult life for you, a life of fearing the next emotional hurdle.

## Looking at yourself from another point of view

We need to start looking at ourselves as the driver of this human avatar rather than looking out through the eye holes and seeing the world from only that viewpoint.

It means understanding ourselves contextually, from within, from the outside, all of it. From all these maps we can build a picture of who we are

<img src='/img/view.jpeg' width='300px' />

> To master your being, you have to know who you are.

We can start off by learning to analyse ourselves from the third perspective, buddists believe in this action for becoming more at peace with oneself. To do so, zoom out a bit like you're looking at yourself from birds eye view, like you are a character in a game.

To see who you really are, set up your phone, turn the face camera on and start talking. Be completely honest and open. talk about things, memories, anything that comes to mind. Then watch the video back again. You can see what others see when they meet you, what you look like when you speak. How your body acted subconsiously as you spoke about emotional topics.

> Think to yourself, is this emotion beneficial for me or not?

### Emotional Immaturity
To be emotionally immature is to still act with the emotions of a child. Try to pin the fault on others, blaming people for 'making you angry/sad/unhappy.

## Becoming the master of your brain
Once you start realising that you are in control of your life, it means to grow up and take responsibility of it.

> true power is to not let others alter your own emotional state. Unless you LET THEM. It must be your choice to allow emotions. Nobody can hurt you if you don't allow their words to have impact

Your emotions are solely made by YOU within your own brain. This means we can actually make changes to the reactions you choose to have.

You can decide whether the world happens to you and you react to it, or you can choose the harder path. You can percieve situations however you want to.

> There is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so - William Shakespere

## Which thoughts are even your own anyway?

An interesting thought experiement to play with is working out where your views actually originated. Question yourself where you found the information?

Often you'll find you might've half heard something, maybe even scanned a news headline, and suddenly you have a viewpoint.

> All of your views should be subject to change, there isn't all that much value in cementing something in 'truth' unless there is significant evidence for it. Just because it FEELs > true doesnt mean it is

### Things that help with generating your own views
Your own thoughts and views on things shouldn't have come from a single other persons opinion, but from many sources that you have carefully read, thought through, and eventually you've formed an opinion

Drop traditional view points, drop prejudice, drop conclusion. Watch your mind when your mind falls for them. It is possible to analyze oneself as you say.

## Emotional Regulation
We know that we are going to experience all kinds of emotions in future, so how, in the moment, how should we react to things?

When a new situation comes up, think actively about logical outcomes of this experience.

Say if your partner cheated on you. Instead of your jerk emotional
reaction of sadness, betrayl, probably feeling shit for a while.

Instead you could reframe the situation in your mind.

- you know..this is great, I've had a suspicion this person was not right for me
- I could take my learnings to my new relationship, looking out for the red flags this time
- It's good it's ending now, what if we had spent years together sad?
- I'm free again!
reframing the situation, no matter what it is, will lead to us being able to logically break down what the best next step to take should be.

> If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment. - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

You can now feel optimistic in a situation that would've made you feel sad beforehand. Now, instead of crying under your bed all day, you can plan out what you're going to do next to get yourself back on track.

### Putting everything through a filter

#### 1. Notice when your emotions are going out of control
Learn to recognise when things are slipping out of control and try to get yourself to sit down. Step out of your mind and identify what is logically going on right now.

You might experience physical reactions like a faster heart rate, tense muscles, and rapid or shallow breathing.
Mentally, you might start losing focus, feeling anxious, panicky or overwhelmed, or feel like you can’t control your thoughts.
Slow down and focus on one element of your body’s reaction at a time. For example, if you’re suddenly feeling anxious, notice what that feels like in your body: “My heart is beating very fast. My palms feel sweaty.” Acknowledge and accept these feelings as they are, rather than judging them
Take a moment to identify what you are feeling, you can to to gain back control by getting into the 'drivers seat' of your brain. This can be done by talking to yourself in your head in third person.

> Lottie is feeling anxious. I know this because Lottie is shaky.
> Lottie needs water. Go get water. Sit down and drink it, we will feel better soon.

Say you’ve been seeing someone for a few months. You tried planning a date last week, but they said they didn’t have time. Yesterday, you texted again, saying, “I’d like to see you soon. Can you meet this week?”

They finally reply, more than a day later: “Can’t. Busy.”

You’re suddenly extremely upset. Without stopping to think, you hurl your phone across the room, knock over your wastebasket, and kick your desk, stubbing your toe.

Interrupt yourself by asking:

- What am I feeling right now? (disappointed, confused, furious)
- What happened to make me feel this way? (They brushed me off with no explanation.)
- Does the situation have a different explanation that might make sense? (Maybe they’re stressed, sick, or dealing with something else they don’t feel comfortable explaining. They might plan to explain more when they can.)
- What do I want to do about these feelings? (Scream, vent my frustration by throwing things, text back something rude.)
- Is there a better way of coping with them? (Ask if everything’s OK. Ask when they’re free next. Go for a walk or run.)

By considering possible alternatives, you’re reframing your thoughts, which can help you modify your first extreme reaction.

#### 2. Breathe deeply
To try this technique, first place one hand on your chest and the other below your rib cage. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose for a count of 4. Feel your lungs and abdomen expand as you fill them with air.
Hold the breath for 1 or 2 seconds, then slowly release the breath through your mouth. Aim for 6-10 deep breaths per minute.
If a full 4-count is difficult for you, you can start with a 2-count and work your way up with practice. Just try to make your breaths as deep and even as you can.


#### 3. Focus on physical sensations to recenter your mind.
Grounding exercises use most or all of your 5 senses to help root you in the present moment. Speaking aloud is especially important, as it shifts your brain away from your emotions. Coming back into your body and focusing on the present moment can help ground you and stop your emotional spiral.
For example, look around and describe aloud what you see. Listen for any sounds you can hear, and state those aloud as well. Notice the smells in the area, and see if you can taste anything on your tongue. You might say, "The carpet and walls are different shades of blue, and the wall art is abstract with blues, reds, grays, and white. I can smell coffee brewing in the break room, as well as the smell of old file folders."
Take notice of what it feels like to be sitting in your chair or holding your coffee mug. Notice how your clothes feel, if any muscles are sore or tense. You can focus on something as simple as your hands being in your lap.
Brew a cup of hot tea and focus on the sensation of drinking it in this moment. How does the cup feel? How does it smell? How does it taste? Describe it aloud to yourself.
Describe a painting aloud, listing as many details as possible. C- arry an essential oil blend to smell when you feel stressed. Let the scent overtake you, and speak aloud about what you like about the scent.

#### Cooling off when you get triggered
Talk out loud if you need to, talk yourself through the situation bit by bit logically. Take a different perspective on the situation, think about the following:

what exactly triggered the emotion in you? What sentence? was it the way it was said?
where does your trigger originate? a bad memory perhaps?
think of an alternate view on the conversation.
think "could I be wrong?" and give yourself a moment to sort out the truth from fiction in your mind

> Remember, our emotions are our responsibility - Swami Mukundananda


## Aim for regulation, not repression

> even if negative circumstances arrive, we can choose the thoughts and feelings that we will harbour towards them

You cannot control your emotions all the time, you're going to be pissed off, upset at something or overjoyed many more times in your life. So long term changes are necessary for us to make improvements.

## Accepting your emotions
All yourself to fully feel emotions, they can be learning experiences For example, try:

“I’m upset because I keep losing my keys, which makes me late. I should put a dish on the shelf by the door so I remember to leave them in the same place.”

Think about what you can do to resolve the situation

Decide how to move forward in the best way you can

## Keep a video diary or journal.
It can really help it see a video, you can see emotional changes in yourself when you might not have noticed the changes. Just set up your phone camera facing you and start talking about how you feel. Talk to yourself in the future, who do you hope they will become?

Recognizing emotions in others

## Regret
Regret is our mind telling us **remember this. this was wrong**. It's there to help us learn for the next time

> The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts. ― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

## Worrying
It can be easy to completely over analyze interactions you have and pick apart what went well and what didn't, for next time. However that's not what confident people do.

confident people do not let mess ups bother them at all, they laugh, learn from it and carry on

forgive yourself when you get things wrong

let yourself move on

With some problems seeing the funny side can make it easier. If you can learn to laugh at yourself many of your worries might go away.

trust yourself that you learnt your lesson and you can move on in your mind

confident people understand that not everybody has to like them

don't talk about your problems and weaknesses in public, other humans are always listening and may decide to use it against you

self-depricating humor can backfire, for some reason humans want to pile up any information they can use to assess you, especially if they don't like you
Talking about your problems in public may get sympathy in the short term but will probably isolate you in the long term

humans are mostly self centered unless they have some sort of emotional attachment to you, they don't care for your backstory (even though they may ACT caring they will be thinking something else)
quote I overheard "I wish guys would stop getting comfortable with me on a one night stand and telling me about their childhood it was so weird"

DEaling with your stress

go for a walk
In an arguement where you're not keeping track of your words anymore?

LEAVE the situation RIGHT NOW, you're at high riskof saying something dumb that you cannot take back


## Guilt
Ok so you fucked up somehow? It's not the end of the world ok? Humans expect apologies on diffrent scales for different acts

> If you think that the world is pitted against you, this is an illusion. Also, everyone feels like this occasionally.

If you think you are to blame for something you must ask yourself if you know that you were doing something wrong. If you didn’t know, or you only had a vague feeling about it then you cannot blame yourself, even if other people are. All you can do is to tell yourself that you will try not to do it again.
Often apologising to someone can help to ease the guilt but ONCE is enough. If you over apologise you might start to look shy or vulnerable.

Emotions

Emotions are like the indicator lights in our car. They give us the status of our body and mind. Our body makes us feel something in our body and we have to interpret the feeling to an emotion.

Our car indicates there's a engine problem, so we have to figure out what the problem is. We don't continue to drive, because at some point it will just stop. With a car, you can go to a mechanic. He can do the diagnosis. For you, you are the only one who can actually do the diagnosis of your feelings and emotions.

There are 2 things that cause emotions:

Someone or yourself is crossing your boundaries.

You are thinking negative thoughts.

To be ridden of a continuous emotional state you need to really start listening to your emotions and deal with them, then the emotion will fade. Just like the engine problem indicator, when the problem it's fixed, the light turns off.

Values and boundaries

We have all have values (virtues and vices) and most people with Aspergers have virtues. When we see or experience things happening that crosses the boundaries of our values we feel hurt, sadness, anger.

You should be aware which values, opinions and self-image you have. These make you an unique person. Look at this image of boundaries.

How the mind works

The mind is just a CPU, processing stuff you put in the input queue. The mind uses mental energy to process. It runs some programs automatically, retrieves data from you memories and returns internal output in the form of thoughts and emotions. The thoughts and emotions will cause you to behave in a certain way.

I made a diagram here: How the mind works Look at it, I'll refer to parts in the text below.

Mental energy and stress

We as Aspergers need to be very protective of our mental energy. We have this sensory problem. Normal people have to process the data from one satellite-dish, we have like 30 satellite-dishes giving us data to process.

Next to external stuff we need to process, we also need to process our own thoughts. Helpful thoughts like analyzing a problem at work, learning stuff and not helpful thoughts (I'll write about them down below). Being focused in gaming or working uses up a lot of mental energy.

When our mental energy reaches low, we get into an emergency-state:

React very emotional in situations.

Feedback sounds like critics.

Having memory problems.

Mentally tired.

You do stuff you don't want to do because you know they are not good.

Normal daily activities are hard.

It's like nobody understand you...

You're in stress and you're living fully automatic by your values and opinions.

To get out of this emergency state you need to rest! That's not sitting on the couch and do nothing.

You need to lower your cortisol by walking or do other activities.

You need to stop wasting mental energy, be very critical of every mental activity.

You need to stop watching tv/movies/series or doing games that cause emotions.

You need to stop (temporarily) hang out with people who cause you emotional distress.

You need to distract your mind:

Walk around and take picture (look for nice compositions/colors)

Listen to music (no emotional text... try foreign music or just instrumental)

Actively feel, taste and smell stuff.. just for the fun of it (we are pretty sensitive as Aspergers... so explore different textures, foods and smells)

You'll definitely notice when you're rested again. Might take some time.

You're only goal in life during emergency-state is: REST. And all your activities need to contribute to this goal!

Automatic processing of thoughts by our mind

In daily life we just live. We do our things. We make little decisions like: "Is it save to overtake the truck?" or "Does the food need extra spices?". These are quite natural decisions. They don't give you a lot of emotions (unless you have driving anxiety).

We also have thoughts like "What does someone think about me?" and then we automatically fill in the answer. Depending on your experiences (which create your values, opinions and self image) you will either think positive: "Yeah, that person likes me because we call a lot." or negative: "No, I haven't heard from the person, so probably not." and you'll feel bad.

These automatically generated bad feelings.. they are the cause of a lot of our stress!

What programs do we have?

We have the following automatic programs:

Storing our experiences as memories and adjusting our values, opinions and self image according to our experiences. And storing new knowledge for future use.

Association of current events to memories. We get the same feeling of something resembles previous experiences.

Check current events or thoughts against our values and boundaries.

The last 2 are causing some problems.

Bad automatic processing

When not aware, we can think a lot: associate and check, associate and check. And mostly it's not productive and actually harmful to ourselves. The following thoughts gives us a lot of negative emotions (anger, sadness and such) and use up mental energy.

Worrying about stuff we are not in control of.

Making wrong negative assumptions.

We condemn instead of judge (and get irritated).

We're mulling about difficult big decisions (when you have proper goals set in your life you'll know what to decide).

And when not careful we're in an endless loop of negative thinking.

Stopping negative emotions

So, now you know how our mind works. The fun is, we can learn how to manipulate our mind! When we can think what we want to think, we can feel wat we want to feel!

Back to the emotions, there are 2 things giving us emotions.

Someone or yourself is crossing your boundaries.

You are thinking negative thoughts.

Learn how to make a self-reflection

For the first one you'll need to learn self-reflection:

What emotion did I feel? What thought did I have at the moment?

What event caused the emotion or thoughts? What did you experience or see/hear?

What values, opinions were crossed?

What do I want to do with it?

Take action!

You'll learn a lot about yourself and how much impact our values and opinions have on our emotions and behavior.

Be clear about one thing: You will always feel emotions, the trick is to speed up the self-reflection and decide how to handle the problem. You need to talk it out with the other person or you can actually decide to discard it, because it's an old value/opinion, which doesn't do you good anymore.

Go and find guides to do self-reflections, practice a lot and you'll soon notice you feel much better.

Learning to control your mind

For the second one you'll need to learn to control your mind. You'll need to practice. Have you ever thought why we need to meditate?

Beginners meditation is all about practicing to control your mind:

just sit or lay down for 10 to 15 min each day.

don't close your eyes fully, be totally aware the full time.

relax your muscles and be aware they stay that way.

start counting your breaths 1 to 10 and start over.

You're mind will automatically start thinking stuff.

You need to feel the emotions you get from your thoughts, let them be and then forcefully park the thoughts and start counting 1 to 10 again. You'll feel the emotions ebbing away.

When I started I was totally not in control of my mind. I would end up counting like 56, 57, 58.. oh shit.. 1, 2, 3. Or my mind had wandered away and I would be thinking about work or whatever. In about 2 months daily practice you'll be doing so much better.

You'll develop focus and mind control.

When you're getting good at controlling, start doing the following:

Be continuous aware of you emotions

Check what thought caused the emotion.

Decide if it is a useful emotion:

Useful: Boundaries are crossed, so you need to do a self-reflection.

Not useful: Bad automatic processing, you need to discard the thoughts and just stop you mind from thinking these thoughts. Just like in the meditation. I just start counting as a help.

We have build op lots of stuff. So we're like Shreks onion. We have layers of unprocessed issues and emotions. You need to peel of each layer. In the center of the onion there's rest.

So don't think you'll be done with one session... you got to do a lot of peeling. When you finally reach the inner part, you'll experience rest. You will know and you'll feel.. enlightened actually.

Again, be aware: You'll always automatically think and experience emotions. You need to reduce the time spend on having these thoughts and emotions. So, practice, practice, practice!

Start personal development!

Did you know Plato had an actual university in Athens to learn how to live your life? Yeah, people just went to university to learn about themselves, so they could live a happy and wonderful life!

We don't have them, so we have to do some research ourselves. The time you'll spend on research and practice will be worth so much, because you'll be more confident as you'll know who you are and you'll know how to guide yourself to the life you want to live.

I've come across guy making video's and podcasts named Leo from actualized.org

I started to listen to his podcasts in the car and they are actually very, very inspiring. I started listening to the ones called Critical thinking, Redefining Philosophy, Selfhelp and Time Management (made in 2014, so a long way down the list).

lay and meditate
