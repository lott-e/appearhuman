# Relationships

### Problems
Which type of person are you?

1. you insist on solving the problem right now
When trying to solve the problem, you're very emotional in the moment.

it doesn't need to be solved right now, don't insist right now things need fixing
it's ok to take a break. pause a moment, take a time out. go take a walk if need be.
later on in the day, find a good moment to bring it up

> if you cannot talk to eachother with civility and respect, then do not continue the conversation until both parties are calm enough

Think to yourself "I'm going to solve the problem. Just not right now. soon."

2. you prefer to avoid conflict and let things go
Things do need to be solved sooner rather than later, if you keep only putting them first, you might start feeling resentment

don't say 'yes' when you mean 'no'


## Recognise the limits of emotion and energy

ask yourself "Can my partner do what I'm asking them to do?"
Think about if it's a good time for them to do this right now

Also take into account your own emotions, be honest with them

Make a code word

> Too overwhelmed? Say "Time out" and instigate the time out protocol. This way you can calmly tell your partner you need space.


### Keep a relationship
Aim to make their life great, stress free and most of all make them feel WANTED and LOVED. (basics of what every human wants)
Take note of things that you do that bring upset/distress to your partner and work to stop doing those things
When having conversations, intently listen to them. Put down your phone, listen to their stories if you want them to listen to yours too
Respect them highly, do not let yourself slip in any argument, some words can never be truly taken back
everybody is taught a lie
why does it matter if youre a dick - a dick is what everyone likes!
My god I was an emotional wreck in the beginning of my relationship.

Lack of experience in peer relationships prevents the development of the common pathway through which adolescents learn about sexuality . Problematic decision-making skills complicate the capacity to maintain the everyday details of a relationship, such as initiating dates, or remembering plans. Lack of flexibility, along with self-absorption, creates significant areas of conflict in a potential relationship. Emotional dysregulation resulting in feelings that are too intense, or perhaps misplaced, together with a lack of awareness of the other’s response can quickly end a relationship. Sensory sensitivities, such as inability to tolerate touch or other physical sensations, sound sensitivities, or food texture issues can cause dating to be fraught with problems
Many persons with ASD have little self-awareness and as noted above, do not understand their impact on others. Another dimension of this issue is that persons with ASD may have little knowledge about themselves. Part of what helps us create a sense of self is the ability to create an internal autobiography [25]. Persons with ASD have difficulty in this area, as they frequently cannot describe their own emotions or are unaware of what they are feeling (i.e. alexithymia) or have difficulty controlling their emotional responses (i.e. emotion dysregulation). As a result, many with ASD lack the ability to insightfully understand themselves or respond to the social climate in a meaningful way. Self-advocacy, a crucial skill for maintaining one’s function in daily life, is something that can be very difficult for a person with ASD to learn

Persons with ASD, either as a result of the above difficulties or due to a true lack of social interest, turn away from others into their own world. Self-absorption fosters another type of social disability. Persons with ASD frequently have restricted areas of interest (e.g. computer animation) and may have little to no desire in sharing this interest with others or attending to the interests of others, since there can be a lack of ability to detach from the area of interest without anxiety or distress. The need for sameness and rigidity in daily routines may supersede one’s ability to flexibly respond to another person, e.g. being unable to eat at another restaurant when only two specific restaurants are in that person’s repertoir

Resolving arguements
The four Absolutes
Honesty - is it true or is it false ?
Unselfishness - Is it selfish? how will this effect the other person?
Purity - Is it right or wrong?
Love - Is is ugly or is it beautiful?
Treat yourself like someone you're responsible for helping
Relationship Arguement, Conflict?
leave eacother, go into different rooms and think about what you brought to the conversation

go back. If you can't come back into the converstaion to try to understand what was going on and make things peaceful again, then you're not ready to go back into the conversation

tell the truth. Honesty is paramount

with problems, don't let them go, Work through it, talk about it until you come to a conclusion

always be present, don't look at your phone. Be present with them, appreciate them
