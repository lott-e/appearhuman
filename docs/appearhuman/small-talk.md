# Small Talk

## Small talk
its a gap filler for silences

everyones polite and cordial

it can be hacked
language is a tool to power language doesnt request permission.

if someone engages in a conversation with you, yoou gotta reply
A always has a general understand of what he wants a person to feel when hes speaking to them

if a person doesnt trust you, theres absolutely no way to align on anything

any point of communication is one that could be used against them
I realised how fucking fake small talk is, and that it is a skill that must be practised again and again

Small talk (I'm referencing when you initially meet someone new here) is a show. It's you making an impression on them and everything that goes down in the first 4 minutes or so is pretty cruicial.

NTs see small talk as a way to 'test the grounds' and bond with someone new. They're not going to emotionally open up to you until they know you better and let their walls down a little.

Make the whole conversation totally about them

yep, that's one of the biggest secrets. It's hard to be so interested in someone you have 0 emtional investment in but go ahead, dig deeper.

Good small talk conversation topics
Your surroundings
This can mean your immediate surroundings, such as the particular street you’re walking on, a restaurant you’re sitting at or a concert venue you’ve heard about that is just around the corner. You can also think on a bigger scale than that and talk about the districts or the city as a whole. Simply looking around will give you many ideas on what to talk about. It can be the atmosphere of the place, stories you’ve heard about it or have experienced yourself, the decor, or any other little detail that catches your attention.

You could ask something simple, for example: “Do you prefer when restaurants have tablecloths or bare tables?”, or something a little more elaborate like “Do you know any good bars with live music in this city?”

Hobbies
Most people love talking about stuff they’re passionate about. And if someone has a hobby, they most certainly have passion for it – that’s what hobbies are, after all.

You can ask the person about something they’re already into, or go with something like “Are there any hobbies you’re thinking of starting up?”

Food
While not everyone is a big foodie, most people do tend to eat something once in a while. So there’s a pretty big chance that it’s gonna be a topic that the other person can relate to.

Asking about preferences is always a safe bet: “Salt or sugar?”, or you could venture a bit deeper and talk about preparing meals at home: “What’s your cooking specialty?”

Weather
It doesn’t get too deep and it’s easily relatable. So it can be a pretty good option to start off with, later transitioning into other, perhaps more interesting topics, if the conversation does pick up.

You could ask them for a personal opinion with something like “Do you think it’s going to rain today?”, or “Do you think this weather is gonna keep up for much longer”. Or you could go with a more practical “Do you know what the weather will be like today?”, but only if you genuinely want to know what the weather is gonna be like.

Work
Work can be a good topic for small talk – expectations, plans, funny stories, comparing your work environments, etc.

“Is your current job what you expected it to be?”. And if you know the other person doesn’t like their job very much, you can let them vent a little by asking something like, “What’s your most frustrating moment at work?”

Entertainment
Pretty much everyone is into something – movies, shows, books, music, theater, youtube, you name it. It’s a fun one to talk about, and it’s a great way to find commonalities.

There are endless questions you can ask when it comes to entertainment, but your best bet is asking about things the other person likes: “Do you like Genre, “Have you read any good books lately?”, or something like “Do you prefer movies that make you think or the ones that let you relax?”

News
You probably shouldn’t go too much into controversial or political themes when it comes to talking about the news casually, but talking about safer, rather more positive happenings – local or around the world – can be a good idea.

You can either bring up something interesting you’ve heard or ask them about something they’ve heard about: “Have you heard anything interesting lately?”, “Do you follow the news?”. The news doesn’t necessarily have to be huge and world-defining – it can even be something simple, like a good new local restaurant opening.

Travel
It’s a topic that lets you learn more about the person you’re talking to – their lifestyle, the way they like to spend their time, and even their goals in life. Besides, travel is usually associated with vacation time, so it’s a pretty positive thing to talk about as well.

If you don’t know whether the person went on any trips recently, you can ask them about some of their latest travels. Alternatively, you can go for something more general, like “What’s your favorite trip ever?” or “How do you feel about being away from home when traveling?”
