## Descisions
My chest feels tight ad I get all tense with descisions. Mainly because I'm so scared of making the wrong one and getting 'in trouble' in some way. This one or that one? it happens when I'm choosing things to buy, getting dressed, multiple times per day.

Life is full of descisions though, you need to really believe in yourself that you're capable of going through with this.

Trusting yourself
Decisions are so difficult... Trust yourself that you would make the best choice for yourself in that moment.
