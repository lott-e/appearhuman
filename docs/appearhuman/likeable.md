# Dislikeable

## How to not be Dislikeable
I'll tell you a secret, before I started taking my communication skills seriously, I was literally not listening to anything that people said. I figured out that I had a deep feeling of not caring. This mainly sporuted from feeling as if others do not care about me, therefore I'm not going to care about them - a shitty spiral.

but what I didn't know is that people can see that you're not listening, they sense it. You're not some evil mastermind who's got everyone fooled.

You need to start legitimately caring about what people say to you

> People older than you and who are more knowledgeable on a subject than you are deserve the spotlight in conversations about that topic. Not you, you don't know shit, you're here to learn from them

> People are taking time out of their day - you're taking 10-20mins of this persons LIFE, take that seriously.

## How to be liked
> it‚Äôs your ability to construct an insightful opinion about a person in seconds that will help make you a fantastic human

People do not like to hear negative talk from you about others, any gossip is a bad thing to spread.

immediately people assume you will definitely talk shit about them behind their back, they'd be right to assume that as you're proving it right now

## Connections
you need to make genuine connections with people

you must truly SEE people, and make them feel SEEN

> You get to choose the type of person you will be, and if you want people to like you

Every single person with whom you work has a vastly different set of needs. Fulfilling these needs is one way to make them content and productive.
it is your full-time job to listen to these people and mentally document how they are built.

> You get to choose the type of manager you will be, and if you want to work with your team

your team are going to notice when you show that you're working hard

> We had no shared experience with him

people need these moments to bond with you, experiences that aren't just do to with work
Organizations of people are constantly shifting around. They are incredibly messy. In this mess, judgments of you and your work will be constructed in moments‚Äîin the ten-second conversations you have in the hallway, and in the way you choose to describe who you are.

Meanwhile, you need to constantly assess your colleagues, determine what they need, and figure out what motivates them. You need to remember that what worked one day as a motivational technique will backfire in two months because human beings are confusing, erratic, and emotional. In order to manage human beings in the moment, you‚Äôve got to be one.

###  Being dislikeable
Being dislikeable doesn't help you get anywhere you want to go in life (unless where you want to be is alone and sad, idk) anyway, don't be dislikeable. There's no point.

This video is a great example of being dislikeable. Contextually the two men either side of the girl (Brie) are actors doing promotional videos for the film they've all starred in. They are putting on an effort to be charismatic, and market the movie. Watch how she makes their job a lot harder and creates a negative atmosphere.

#### Notes on what she says
Brie is being totally disagreeable for no good reason at all. The situation they are in and the great things that came out of this movie opportunity do not call for this behaviour

Too literal in her thinking, Brie does not allow for abiguity. She assumes negative intention behind everything people say - What she wants to hear takes priority over what is actually being said .

2:08 the situation has gotten really really bad. She said something negative and should have been ready for the consequence(to have something negative said about about her)

When Brie laughs, the laugh is cut short, it makes tthe laugh appear fake

Given the opportunity to speak on others, Brie chooses not to praise them

A lot of what she says does sound like sarcasm but her delivery makes the listener uncertain of intention. Therefore the guys with her hear the statements as truth.

over exagerrate with your sarcasm. The tone of voice should change, some people even use a silly voice so you can tell the difference.

####  Body Language
Detailled well in this video

What others said -

> "honestly theres not much of a problem with her, she just doesn‚Äôt know how to tell sarcasm correctly which makes people hate her and think shes serious when shes actually joking. "

> " At any moment she's gonna randomly make whatever is going on in the room 100% about her for absolutely no reason: narcissism."

> "I think it‚Äôs really just that she can‚Äôt tell when it‚Äôs a joke and takes it too far, then it becomes annoying. Like they actually look like they don‚Äôt wanna be there with Brie ü§£"

> "I feel like the problem with Brie is that she either takes things too far or just says things the wrong way. Like, obviously all the actors joke around and say that their character is the best/strongest or whatever, but she brings it up in like every other sentence. And she always says ‚ÄúI‚Äù, not even Carol or Captain Marvel. Or like when Don joked, ‚ÄúBrie just has to not screw it up.‚Äù Her first response was fine, that‚Äôs what most people would say. But then she keeps running too far with it and says something along the lines of ‚ÄúThanks for dumping on me‚Äù Like? It‚Äôs a joke? She just takes jokes too far and too personally, and doesn‚Äôt quite use sarcasm in a way where you can tell she‚Äôs joking."

> " i don't think she is a really a funny/sarcastic kinda person, because she doesn't know how to make the sarcasm funny like Robert she ends up looking kinda mean and attacking everyone."

> "Brie just completely oblivious to the fact she‚Äôs annoying the hell out of everyone üåù"
