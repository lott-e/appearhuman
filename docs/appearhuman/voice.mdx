# Tone of Voice

  Tone of voice refers to any vocal nonverbal cues a person is giving off
Your tone communicates a lot more than you might realise. People find the 'true' meaning of your sentence through the way in which you said it. Humans are more likely to believe these non verbal cues than the statement itself.

For instance, compare the following:

The panda eats shoots and leaves

The panda eats, shoots and leaves

In the first sentence, you find out about what pandas eat. The second sentence is a bear walking in, shooting something, and leaving the place. The comma made all the difference, the comma being a pause for breath to emphasise meaning. People do the same thing but with the way they speak, they add the punctuation in with their vocal delivery.

A compliment can come out as an insult if said with a different twang in your voice. If you say a sentence with monotone delivery (this means keeping the same pitch) it can be seen as rude.

To say a sentence in a way that isn't rude you should use more pitch variations as demonstrated in the following clip:

### How to sound friendly
- use a soft voice more variation in your pitch and a higher tone is percieved as friendly

### How to sound excited
- use a high pitch
- lengthen words in your delivery

### How to sound sarcastic

### How to sound authoritive
If you're in a bar and the waiter has ignored you for a while, this is the tone you might use to show your annoyance at being ignored.

### monotone and direct

- direct pitch is sometimes a little threatening to people
harsh

### How to sound indifferent
- this is monotone, without amny pitch changes sentences are left hanging without a cut, emphasising the fact you don't care all that much

### How to sound angry

- everything you say should sound sharp, with short clear words to emphasise your anger
- at the end of each sentence it sounds like your voice is dropping in pitch
energised voice


See in this clip how the meaning of the sentence changes depending on the tone of voice used:

- work out the tone of voice that you have
- ask yourself what your tone of voice is communicating to those around you

> If you sound timid in your voice, people will automatically assume that you are submissive in nature. Perhaps they might talk over you

> If you sound angry a lot, people will assume you're frustrated with THEM. Even though you might not be, if you're angry for no clear reason, they'll assume

- speak slowly, calmly and clearly
- keep a good posture when speaking, it helps with airflow
