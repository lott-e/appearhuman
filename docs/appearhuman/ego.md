# Ego

Breaking up with your own ego

## If you just say "I" all the time, people won't want to be around you
Blaming someone else, whining. Don't expect people around you to care.

Quietly get along with your life, you'll be liked by others.

Talk more, a few extra words could make a great impression

### Don't stay with what you know
We tend to settle so quickly with what we see as comfortable

### Admire other people
### Find the ability to give.
