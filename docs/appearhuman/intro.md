# What is a 'Normal?'

Humans have a perception of something they call 'normal'. 'Normal' by definition means something that does not stand out, something that is 'like everything else'. Humans view anything that doesn't adhere to social rules as a direct threat to survival. Humans are tribal creatures. we sort ourselves into tribes or cliques and are driven to conflict with one another

Some people rely primarily on social cues and conformity so look right, talk right, you're one of us = accepted!

The simple fact you're saying "Normal people" makes up for everything, you judge way too much, focus on individuals, not in certain groups.

>  To be 'normal' like the majority of other humans within the given group, blend
>  in, do not stand out{' '}

**Normal** - To have all the qualities of the majority of people in your group, culture, or the world. The common and expected adjectives of a person and there attitude that barely define who they are as an individual.
its normal to be that way (alot of people are), thats normal, there's nothing normal about that (cause its unusual which is an antonym to normal)

Normality is a way to identify with other people in a way that makes the so called "normal" or "common", even average, way of being. This normality is quick to enroot a cynical thought to those who think about what is the true definition of "normal" in these days, and people who stand out in the crowd are starting to define a new kind of normality called "abnormalism" or "freak-show".

Normality was once being an upstanding member of society when now it englobes a whole new spectrum of beings, from tatooed freaks to whiny teenagers, or even the other way around, as being a slacker is now conformity or normality.
Anbormality is normal.

```md
1)John didn't want to use his sneakers to go to work. Instead he applied blonde hair spray and went to his job shirtless and wearing flip-flops.

2)That guy with a lazy eye and a watermelon tied to a chain is very normal for these days.

Conforming to a type, standard, or regular pattern characterized by that which is considered usual, typical, or routine.

Examples: Normal working hours. || Under normal circumstances. || It was just a normal , average day. || He had a normal childhood. ||

Some things you posted...

- I just wanna be normal or not like this
- Does anyone else feel like there’s a “barrier” between you and normal people?
- I wish I could be normal
- How do you find the balance between being yourself and acting 'normal'?
- I just wanna be okay… I just…wanna be…..like them….
- 21 with aspergers completly alone and I wishes that she could be normal


I always knew I was different, the diagnosis put a name to it and called it a 'disability' which upset me as I never thought of myself as disabled before then - just different. The label is helpful if you're going to use it to identify your differences and work through them. At first it was like a miracle that finally someone (GP) understood, but then after telling everyone around me about it, things didn't get better. The label started to make me feel more different and incapable of doing social things because now I had a clear reason for why I suck socially. Honestly I did use it as an excuse for my depression and such. Super glad it's been helpful for you to learn it though

- don't tell people about it, it's your own secret to understanding your behaviours
- keep looking t the positives that come from having aspergers
- unique = awesome
- Don't let it be the focus of your life


## Who are 'they'?
Imo, it’s all mimic. I highly doubt they “know” in the absolute sense of knowing. They watch, observe, and copy. The behaviour itself may not make sense, but since they’re all copying each other, they look “normal”.

For us, since our social switches are turned off, it doesn’t come naturally to watch, observe and copy people. Takes a bit more effort and nudging.

Ohh man it's a never ending struggle. I had an argument TODAY about this. In the same way that you struggle to understand what it would be like to be a neurotypical, they cannot understand what it would be like to be you.

- Seriously give up trying to get NTs to understand/ change their behaviour for you
- Your diagnosis is for you to understand yourself. Only tell those super close to you, let it go if they're not interested in trying to understand your issues
- Nobody is going to go away and read up on aspergers to learn how to 'best communicate with you' - again, do not try to change people's behaviours
- It's easy to fall into the trap of 'you don't have it as hard as I do because you don't have aspergers' thing...try not to do that, NTs have their own problems too
- "It's because I have aspergers" always always always comes across as an excuse to NTs rather than an explanation for your behaviour. It's probably not the case that your parents don't care, they just don't know what it feels like inside your head. Why is it important that they know? What would it change?
But NTs, some of us go through hard things too. Not usually on a daily basis or minute by minute basis but we’ve most likely dealt with similar issues like depression and anxiety… most likely on a different level. But any kind of level of those types of things pretty much suck.

It's pointless wishing you were like 'normal' people, because you're not; it's just wasted energy that you could be putting into actually making positive steps to living life as a happy person with ASD. You can find your own ways to deal with the things that distress and bother you for example, such as minimising sensory issues. OP - you don't say what you've tried to deal with that - do you use noise cancelling headphones for example? Best thing I've ever done is actually pay attention to my sensory issues, not just try to bulldoze/suffer through them. I bought noise cancelling headphones, I'm much more willing to nope out of things - to go 'nope, not today', and pay attention to rationing my sensory input. With regards to having a racing brain that is always thinking - boy, I can relate to that. My autistic friend is different to me and finds it weird that I can be having about four different thoughts at once but pretty much my brain never stops thinking. I relax by knitting and taking walks in nature (I like to bird watch so I'm usually trying to identify birds whilst I do it) - relaxing doesn't have to be having no thoughts, it can be just directing those thoughts to one chilled out thing (I get my thoughts to slow down to sleep for example by focusing on something really boring, like what I'm going to have for dinner the next day!), slowing your thoughts down and getting out of your head just a bit - stuff that makes you focus on listening or doing stuff with your hands is really good. Might take trying lots of things to find what works for you. A lot of people like meditation but personally meditation can actually push me towards a meltdown - it makes me really angry - and if it doesn't work for you, that is fine, you can find other stuff that does.

Basically, you have to find ways of making your life work for you, even if that is very different from how that works for 'normal' people.

We don't need to be like them to be happy.

some people don't want normal, they want you. I also accepted i am and will never be 'normal'. These days i find i quite enjoy the label of ND and am very open with people about it so they accept me for who i am or don't. The only person you're supposed to be is you.

## ...but what if I want to tell people?
One can explain without Big Name Reasons.

## Masking

Masking is a common term for behavior intended to mask neurodivergent traits with the intention of appearing more 'normal'. Masking is creating a persona to enable you to socialise.

NTs aren't even this way. People are always masking around other people. The advice for autistic people should be learn WHEN you're masking so you can unmask when alone and not get burned out, a trait NTs do automatically.

But unmasking at work will get you fired. Unmasking at a social event won't endear you to anyone. Just like an NT is taught to not call her boss an asshole or take his pants off when he gets hot at a party.

Being around other people is a showcase of your ability to make people comfortable with your presence, so you can trade that social capital for things you need from society. Just because you're uncomfortable doesn't mean you can't do it.

Masking is essentially taking on a role for whatever group you're in.

The how is study a person that is similar to you in looks and generally admired in a group and emulate their patterns. You can do this in real life or with TV characters as long as you soften their edges to be more realistic. The aim is to gather enough traits that are desirable to others in different arenas (work self, party self, person on the street self, roommate self) and practice them enough that they become comfortable and natural.

I'm happy to chat about it more via DM if you're interested. My job for years was managing high-end restaurants and training people how to be charming in bite-sized chunks, and obviously before that I had to train myself how to be charming enough to get that position, so I'm quite studied in it and always happy to share tips.

It is and isn't. At its heart, it is acting. It is why Shakespeare said all the world is a stage.

NTs aren't always aware when they're acting. They are aware sometimes. We just happen to be aware basically all the time, which can be exhausting unless you learn to manage it.

But it's a skill like any other. Once you've practiced enough, it becomes second nature. The difference is we will always recognize when we are employing a skill, rather than behaving "naturally."

It's kind of like being out of the Matrix. You can walk around in it and play along to your benefit, but you know it's ultimately a construct that you choose to engage with or not, while NTs tend to just engage with it because it's all they know.


Turns out, most people have a mask, ot just the one, they have many for different situations

Alex has a public speaking voice that he does when talking to the team or investors on Zoom calls, he's more upbeat, loud, will laugh and try to make others laugh a lot. His pitch changes a lot whilst story telling.
When he's at home, he's got a far quieter, monotone voice, more logical
Alex tells me he has to keep up the work persona as ithas a lot of function

Masking
I disagree with the common therapy touting of 'never mask, be yourself always.' Mainly because humans have tons of masks.

Not masking but jus adapting yourself to diff situations correctly

First thing you need to break out of is the concept of being normal. For some reason people have decided that society can function if people were absolutely equal the standard of which is called normal, which is total bullshit. Society heavily rely on people being unique and different from each other because if most people start leaning in one direction society falls, here comes the need for an extremely unequal person who stand out not necessarily positive but that is the person who can lead society out of ditch who is not down there with them. Be proud of being not normal and do thing your own way. Break free of constraints that are not useful. Take responsibilities, if you can do that well enough people will be following your example.

you're not normal but that doesn't mean that your issues are way worse than everyone without apergers. Because empathy is difficult for us, understanding oher peoples struggles is diffficult, you can only really understand your own experience, and from that you feel you had it bad.

If you learn all the skills now, you'll be able to improve your abilities and become that person you desire to be in the near future.

Your diagnosis is confirmation and helpful categorisation of your issues socialising. If we can pinpoint our issues, we can target and learn to make them less of a hassle in our lives

> Pro tip: If you don't mask, you don't have to worry about slipping up. Also I don't understand why everyone thinks every person is obligated to like them. Just be yourself from > > the beginning, don't take it personally if people don't like you, and then you'll meet awesome and accepting people who are better to have in your life - [TheNomadicAspie](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/r48kee/comment/hmgufrk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

A 'coping strategy' is usually defined as a load of behaviours you've memorised. During social situations, you fake it all the time. which is exhausting for you. Faking it is harming your ability to progress.

What we want is fundamental and permenant changes to the way we do things.
We are imporving our true selves.

## Become your true self
It took a while but now I speak to my partner in my low monotone voice, I laugh in the weird dude-like way I laugh and I love it, it's me.

## The label
Symptoms of being unable to communicate with humans falls under this term of 'autism' maybe you've been told you have 'aspergers' or that you're 'unsocialable', 'neurodivergent', etc. You go to the doctors, go through this long process to get the label, then you leave the office with your new label but nothing actually changed in your environment. You always knew you were different, this label just put a name to it.

I don’t think the diagnosis, or the counselling where you get talked to all softly, or the specialised 'quiet area in college for disabled kids' helps you fit into society any better. you've always known you're different but suddenly you feel like a completely different species, incapable of fitting in to the real world.

Annoyingly, if you start joining online forums about being different, there's an awful lot of talking about the fact you're different rather than trying to change and become not so different.

> The more you read about your differences, the more different you're going to feel

## So what now?

- Your diagnosis is NOT your whole personality, it is an umbrella term for the behaviours you display sometimes
- Being envious of those born without your differences is not helpful to you
- the people around you are probably not going to care about your label
- the label is not an excuse for not being able to socialise
- you might want things to be completely negative and are not seeking out what the positives are about your differences
- this is not your personal pity party, also you don't want to be treated as different that would suck.
- Just lying there and getting upset that you're different is NOT going to help you on your way to achieving goals

> It's not all bad and being 'normal' also doesn't guarantee that everything will be good.

You cannot expect people around you to change their behaviour towards you to make the world more comfortable for you, that's not the real world.

## Don't tell people about it
'Normal people' really struggle to understand soemthing they don't know, something they haven't felt. That's also something you probably struggle with too. Given that that is true, telling people who don't have aspergers that you have aspergers is going to get the following:

Typical answers you're gonna hear

"you dont seem/look autistic"

"you seem normal to me"

"there's nothing wrong with you"

"I don't get that impression from you"

"I would've never guessed"

"Really? I can't tell"

"There's no such thing as normal. What's normal?"

"Everyone has something these days"

"Everyone is always looking for some type of label these days"

"Everyone has autism these days"

"Everyone has some type of mental illness these days because its trendy"

"Everyone's a little bit autistic"

## Deal with it
you have to decide to take the leap and learn the social skills

> Is it so difficult to believe that things aren't completely terrible?

I hated being told this at first and you're probably going to hate it also, you might have those same feelings of anger, feeling tha the world is 'out to get you', that its all so unfair. It's not all that bad though.

Using ASD as an excuse is like if for example Alice were to say 'I cannot be a firefighter because I am a woman' and people would tell her how silly that is. Sure, a woman might have less muscle mass and have a clear disadvantage to a man in the same position but still, she could go ahead and become a firefighter. She could go work out daily at the gym and make her differences less apparent.

Alice shouldn't let the fact she's a woman stop her from achieving her goal of becoming a firefighter. Just like you shouldn't use your label as an excuse not to have the life that you want.

- You should learn to cope and deal with it and not be so negative all the time.
- Even if you weren't autistic, you'd still have things you'll never be able to experience. And you might experience (positive) things BECAUSE you are autistic

> "Meh it's just annoying that people blame all their problems on their autism and think they'd have it so much better if they were normal. They'd probably still be awkward as fuck, > as if normal people don't ever get socially awkward."

> "Just trying to explain that autism is the worst thing in the world, it doesn't make you a special snowflake and that being normal probably sucks just as much. I guess it's just  easier to pray for a cure than to deal with your shit."

Here is an incredibly inspiring talk by Sean Stephenson that really put me in my place with my thinking.

I got the impression that actually I'm making it all worse for myself if I label myself. Sean sure doesn't label himself as incapable of living a great life, why should I let my thoughts of inferiority get to me?

> You’re only someone with 'special needs' if you choose to be

## Identifying differences
You were born the way you were born, whether thats from an egg, a different planet, in a swamp, birthed from a Galactagon, built in a factory, look I don't know. All I know is that you're you and that's that. Let's not focus on why you're so different, but focus moreso on how to interpret humans and get along with them, because that's the point of this book.

> Autism is one of the few disabilities which isn't 100% negative, but this is almost never acknowledged. Focusing on the negative and trying to fix unfix-able issues only has lead > to about 40% of autistics being depressed. How about learning some coping skills to deal with your disability and acknowledging the things that AREN'T shit?

Your differences are seeds of information you're going to identify and use to your advantage. You can choose to let your differences rule your life, or make the choice to learn to blend in and minimise your differences where necessary.

> "I wouldn't wish away my brain if I could, it's the only one I've got and I'm actually kinda glad I can observe the world and it's inhabitants in my own way, even if I can't quite understand it."

### Choice 1 - keep the label


<img src='/img/sadfrog.jpeg' />

never be able to socialise without anxiety making the whole experience awful for you
feel like you'll never fit in and that nobody will ever understand
embarassingly socially unaware and have moments that keep me up at night
develop eating disorder because obsession with numbers and routine
freak out at the slightest unplanned change of routine
real bad mental blindness
hate being hugged, touched, having people near you
unable to visit nughtclubs, trainstations or anywhere loud as noise is painfully loud to you. super sensitive to external sounds
being a very picky eater because food textures
Can't make decisions because thinking too deeply into how it effects everything else
Only interested in staying in comfortable environment
dissasociate often, be in a completely different world to everyone else
live in your own head
keep being really bad at making friends, keeping friends, relating to other people, and responding to social cues
accept a life of isolation
be unable able to understand facial expressions
don't look people in the eye, why bother
uncontrollable emotional meltdowns that lose friendships, relationships, trust
sucidal thoughts
struggle a lot harder than others to verbally express myself or keep a conversation flowing
feel like your crazy / broken
social isolation
My personality is awful and selfish
I spend a lot of time daydreaming scenarios in my head while laying in bed and they bring me some happiness.

> can’t force eye contact for more than about 4 seconds, feels too “intimate” social awkwardness despite being “aware of myself” feeling like i have to “fake” facial expressions because my natural face doesn’t really show emotion naturally monotone, “robotic” voice anxiety in social situations leading me to isolate myself some common comorbid disorders like OCD and misophonia ive had some obsessive “special interests” trouble relating to the majority of people, distant from both parents

Efforts to leave the house usually go something like this:

> ”maybe if i go in public, someone will talk to me…” walk around mall aimlessly for an hour see groups of people my age hanging out together happily feel worse leave May as well just rot in my room instead of wasting gas.

"I’m not necessarily “dealing with it”. This past year, I’ve kind of socially isolated myself. Most of my time is spent alone in my bedroom, a predictable environment where I feel safe. I’ve had social anxiety since middle school and find interacting with people exhausting. Therapy and medication never worked."


> "I have literally no friends. The majority of the social interactions I hold are online and I even get anxious doing that, because I’m constantly worrying I’ll run out of things to say and make the conversation awkward. Irl conversations, especially small-talk, are another realm of hell for me. Eye contact is impossible to hold and feels extremely intimate and awkward. Unintentionally, I come off as cold and uninterested."

> " i dont fit into society or any groups of people and i really wanna cease existing"

> Having a huge sensitivity to sounds. I have to wear earplugs at night to sleep. The sounds of people eating, slamming doors, coughing/sneezing, hacking up phlegm, singing, talking to themselves, snoring, even fucking breathing stresses me out so much. My doctor says I'm stressed and that I should practise meditation but how can I when there are sounds everywhere? Lol A counselor once made me do an online test which was very positive. Obviously she said it wasn't confirmation but it was a sign that I should get it checked out but I didn't know how to proceed from there so I just left it. I seem to always offend people even when I'm really not trying to. I always read everything I'm posting multiple times (incl this post), trying to make sure nothing I say sounds aggressive or could be taken out of context but for some reason people find everything I say offensive. It's not just online, this happens in person too. I also let a lot of personal information slip when I'm trying to make a joke and it's cringey af when I think about it later. Have absolutely 0 imagination. Have to force myself to make eye contact with people constantly. Struggled a lot in school/college and came out with well below average results despite trying really, really hard. Never learned how to properly write an essay/thesis and could never retain information. Basically couldn't come up with my own thoughts and relied on the opinions of others way too much. Have problems socialising. Even just hanging out with friends is really exhausting. I'm meeting people tomorrow and instead of being excited, I'm dreading it. I always meticulously prepare for phone calls or emails, they take me a really long time to do. yesss. i hate fruit, it disgusts me. i can smell bananas and oranges from metres away and it makes me feel sick, in the way a strong chemical smell would. weirdly fruit juice and vegetables are ok though.

Basically autism symptoms fall in three categories

## social interaction
- have to think before saying anything
- finds social interaction tiring/ exhausting

## sensory issues

## systematic thinking.
- a need for strict routines


In the first one I've got the usually well known stereotypes of struggling with interaction, finding it tiring because it doesn't come to me naturally and I have to think before I say anything, feeling anxiety because of that, having issues putting myself in other people's shoes, not detecting teasing or sarcasm… Women generally do better in this area than autistic males, because while they're not born knowing the rules of social interaction, they can learn from observing their peers. Personally I've been told I seem normal when I interact with people, I just seem a bit shy and quiet, but interaction really tires me out and I avoid it when I can.

I've got symptoms in the second category as well : loud and repetitive sounds really upset me and I can't go outside without headphones, I'm really picky with my food because of textures (stringy and crunchy things disgust me), I don't like physical contact even with my family and friends… I also have a hard time knowing where I am spatially and I bump into things without noticing, I only know afterwards from seeing my bruises.

Lastly the systematic thinking stuff relates to being attached to logic and order in some areas of your life, for me this expresses in having certain routines (I always eat from the same bowl, always take the same path to certain places even if it's inconvenient, always approach things the same way) and feeling anxiety when my routine changes, or when I can't plan things ahead in detail (for example, when I go somewhere new I always check the path on Google Street View so I can imagine how I'll get there, and I try to find pictures of the inside of buildings so I can figure out what I'll do when I get there and how I'll get out). I guess special interests fall in that category too. I have one special interest I've had all my life and feel very strongly about, and I get new ones once in a while that I obsess over for a month or two, keep a lot of notes on and think about almost non-stop until I move on.

## What you're really good at

- curiousity to learn new things

- hyper fixating on subjects you like

## normal people
Who are these 'normal people'? They're people you don't understand yet so theres no need to assume they're life is soooo much better than yours seeming as they have no label. The 'normal people' you're referring to aren't all angels themselves. Maybe they dislike other people too, thing is they just wouldn't tell you about it

you know everything about what makes you autistic and how it makes you different to society don’t you? Why? You’ve studied it. You could explain it for hours.

Now imagine you spent the same amount of time, that same brain space on studying the Neurotypicals. You’d be able to chat to me for hours instead about how to be like them, what specifically makes them NTs.

Makes sense doesn’t it?

Think to yourself - "what if I just -decide- to be neurotypical?"

Be respectful to Neural Typicals. It is destructive to hate them. For some people they never had to thought about what it like to be disabled. Do not think of them as an Enemy. Think of them as another person. You can make them your allies. The LGBT community has to do this as well. Nothing is black and white. Everything is different shades of gray. Core Values may be Black and White, but how we function is in the Gray. Your family, coworks, and friends are used to seeing the world a certain way. It is like how a white person would see the world with white privilage, but would not see all the things that a black person disadvantges a black person would have. You have to show them how things are different. Just explaining it will not always work. Also you have to stop telling people how wrong they are or that they did something wrong. You have to treat them like how you would be like to be treated and that can be the most difficult thing to do.

## Asking the world to change for you
"I want to make a guide/list for my colleagues: how to work best with me and my Aspergers

For example:

I need things to be defined very concretely. Abstraction is the enemy of progress.

I need to know what the problem is that I have to solve in an assignment.

I need to have my alone time in a quiet environment so I can focus really well.

I need my lunch so I can recharge. That means that sometimes I will have lunch with just 1 person, not with several strangers.

What else would you put on the list? "

this is super super super entitled behaviour, how do you think people are going to react to you asking them to change THEIR BEHAVIOUR to suit YOU.
you cannot ask the world to change for your needs, what would happen if everyone tried to do this?

## TIps for surviving parties
Firsty well done for making it in there, it's so nerve wracking to even get into there but you did it!

look at people between the eyes to avoid overwhelming feeling
people think ur self absorbed because youre not looking at them!!

## Becoming 'normal'
I wish I knew when I was younger that those 'normal' people I so craved to be were not as interstesting as I am? They don't get to see the world like I do, they worry so much about social hierarchies and being 'liked' by their peers. Actually I enjoy being me, hearing a constant logical monologue in my head can be fun.

For example, observing people at a party. That's how I made myself go, I told myself - "let's go and oberserve how the neutrotypicals react in this environment", I was going in as an observer so it wouldn't feel as scary, I'm on a mission here.

## Seriously, be YOU!!
> own your condition. It makes you different and that's a super power most people don't have

Being totally blunt and honest is awesome, it's hard to say what I realy want to often as I'm scared of hurting the other persons feelings, however I do realise that being honest is actually way better than trying to lie (because I'm shit at lying). Being unapologetically myself is what I want to be always, it will just be a gradual process.

//but owning my weirdness has been wonderful. There is nothing shameful in being weird, or in having a brain that works differently from the way other people's brains. If I prefer being alone in a quiet apartment to dancing in a loud bar, that's not shameful and I have the right to have my preferences. If I don't react to a social situation the way someone else would, that's not shameful either - everyone is different. If I read 5 times as fast as normal people read, or notice typos at a glance, that's not shameful and I don't need to hide it - everyone is different

"How to own your Aspergers; a community guide Hey guys, I've recently been exited about owning my condition and my feelings rather than hiding them for fear of being different and wanting social acceptance. I was only diagnosed last week and i feel like an enormous weight has been lifted from me. Here's some examples in my daily life about owning it and not hiding it. Please share your examples too. Here are some of mine:

Guy criticizes my form on the squat at the gym. I tell him I have a neurological disorder that makes it so i have terrible coordination and the fact that I'm even here is a small miracle. Guy looks puzzled, but whatever.

Girl at my gym class invites to to take a spinning class. I say I don't really like the loud, aggressive music because that's just the way I am.

Go out dancing with a friend, place gets too crowed and makes me feel uncomfortable. Tell my friends this and gfto. Didn't feel the slightest pressure.

It feels fucking liberating, do it, do it now!"

> Same I hate sympathy. I feel patronised when people feel sorry for me or trat me like I have something wrong with me.

How to avoid sympathy? If I tell people about my leg, in a very positive way, then that person sees that I am really happy with myself and my siutation and then I NEVER get the sympathy card. Once I figured this out, I stopped hiding it.

Now when someone asks, I pull up my pant leg, show them my prosthetic leg, and how cool certain things are about it. I tell them it's from birth, so I never 'lost' anything. I do this with a smile and confidence. Now all I get is some interesting questions and a "cool!" and we move on.

When I tell someone I have aspergers, I tell them "I have what's typically reffered to 'aspergers', it means that I think fundamentally differently than most other people, I see the concepts behind how things work and am naturally attuned to engineering. In order for me to do this though, I don't process social cues all that great and so I'm often really quiet in groups, or once I do start talking, I'll not shut up about what I'm currently fascinated or working on.

> I am not broken, I am just different. The people around me have either learned to jive with that - or they stopped being my friend.

Attempting to "fit in" and act "normally" was exhausting and pointless. I wasn't fooling anyone - and I was making my life 10X harder then it needed to be. Just living through a single day shouldn't make one so overwhelmed and tired that they feel physically ill and can't sleep due to migraines. As soon as I stopped pretending, and just started acting in the way that came natural to me (even if some people find it off-putting) I felt loads better. Physically - I stopped feeling as ill, mentally - it was like dancing. Not having to worry how others are going to perceive my actions was a load of weight off my shoulders that I never realized I was carrying.

> I barely tell anyone ever that I have aspergers.. What is it gonna add? Understanding? No, believe me, it does not.. Pity? Maybe.. But what good is pity, really?
