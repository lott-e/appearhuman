# Empathy
> the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

Watch the following clip, Mark could be being totally serious when he said "I’m really sorry that this happened”. However the signals he gives off makes people see only deceptive intent

annoyingly, people aren't listening to WHAT you said but HOW you said it. - people need to see your words match up with your body language

> I was diagnosed with Aspergers. I mean, I'm good at understanding people's emotions, I just don't care about them.

> Sometimes it's social cues that are hard to read, not emotions

## Two sides of an arguement
I had a dumb arguement with my partner Alex and this my wirting about it afterwards as I was confused it happened.

I can’t blame Alex, he’s a representation of how the whole NT world feels about you and your differences.

What happened today? IN MY HEAD

I got up and routine I was going to do was

Workout for 30 min
Shower and wash my hair
Eat some porridge
Sit down and work
Instead I wanted to make Alex (and myself...) happy by going to get lunch at corner place.

But to get there in time I had to

Quick shower and not wash hair
Get dressed
Ask him what he wants…
Maybe wash my hair later on
I came back in and apologised and said I didn’t mean to offend him and then bigger argument ensues.
Then we had an argument.
He said he’s angry at the fact
I get anxious over these little things (such as routine changes or picking up food)

and the fact I can’t just make a decision and go with it

He told me to stop looking at Asperger Reddits and stop associating myself with those groups because it makes me think I can use Aspergers as excuse.

TO ALEX what happened today?

I said I’d go get food
I asked twice what food he wanted and interrupting him working
I asked questions like
Do they do takeout?

Should I take a bag? Or will they give me one?

I asked again what he wanted, he mixed up the name of a dish and I said ‘can’t you read?’

He got mad

I left but only put on shoes

I came back in which angered him more

Then we argued

He explained why he’s mad

The fact I can’t just make decisions on my own

The fact little things give me anxiety

He spoke to me like I’m a child and gave me 5 minutes to ‘fix this’

I tried to explain but didn’t give explanation he wanted

He asked what I needed to hear for things to return to normal

Said he’s under a lot of stress with startup

He doesn’t want added stress of handling me and my emotional issues.. he’s got big things to worry about rn and I have habit of making it all about me

## Why am I going to change?
I want to be seen as great for who I am.
I do not want the label so I should stop putting it on myself.
Our own prison is our own minds
I want to stop the anxiety, the crying, the being different thing.
This strength can only come from within myself.
So here’s what I’m going to do
No longer mention Aspergers to people.

No more reading about it

Including reddit, memes, YouTube

No more writing about it. (lol except in this book)

No more letting it take over. I must fight it

Stop taking things so literally.
Yeah. Stop caring. NTs don’t care for literals or truth.

The ‘bigger truth’ is irrelevant. people don’t care for it.

Think about what somebody is trying to say, not the words themselves.

Say what people what to hear
It is far easier to just say what people want to hear than to worry about saying a correct statement.

Understand that you are hard to communicate with. Not them. It’s you who needs to change
You’re speaking a different language honestly how do you expect to communicate with anyone
