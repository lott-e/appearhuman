## Phrases

Humans have a way of saying a sentence that is not relevant to the given situation, yet the sentence gives a hidden meaning that most people all understand. Phrases seem to be tidbits of knowledge passed down through generations.

You can spot a saying when the sentence that person just said did not make sense contextually. There's also a change of voice pitch into a 'I told you so/ah I knew this would happen' type sound. Humans recall thee saying to point and categorise a given siuation and say 'ah this has happened before."
