# Appear Human
Aspegers sucks and learning to communicate is hard

A manual to learn how to be human, or a least appear like one. For aliens who struggle to fit in and want the black and white answers. For anyone wanting the guide to confidence in social situations, the no bullshit look on social heriarchies on why the humans do what they do.

> KNow the humans. Speak like the humans. Become one with the humans

Premise is this. Newt takes video logs of her discoveries each day on the humans. She learns new things about how they function, how to blend in with them, and why they do the thingss they do. The video media must be entertaining in its own right.
